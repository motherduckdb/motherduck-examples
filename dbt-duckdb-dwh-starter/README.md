# Build a MotherDuck Warehouse with dbt and Deploy a Dive

A minimal `dbt-duckdb` starter for building a MotherDuck warehouse end to end and
shipping a Dive on top of it. It reads the Common Crawl domain hyperlink graph
(which sites link to a target domain) straight from remote gzip files, joins it
with the Hacker News dataset, and builds tested mart tables. A deploy script then
publishes a Dive that visualizes the marts. It shows the MotherDuck pattern of
turning large remote CSV/gzip sources into performant tables with dbt, combining
datasets across a share, and deploying a Dive as code.

With this setup you'll learn how to:

- Turn large CSV/gzip source data into performant MotherDuck tables
- Combine data from different sources (Common Crawl + a Hacker News share) with dbt
- Deploy a MotherDuck Dive from validated, tested marts

## How it works

The dbt project layers staging, intermediate, and mart models, each in its own
schema suffix (`<DBT_SCHEMA>_stg`, `_int`, `_mart`):

- `models/staging/commoncrawl`: source-backed tables over the Common Crawl remote
  gzip files for the configured `commoncrawl_snapshot`. The default snapshot
  `cc-main-2026-jan-feb-mar` exposes three outputs: `domain-ranks` (PageRank and
  harmonic centrality), `domain-vertices` (domain ids and reversed host names),
  and `domain-edges` (domain-to-domain links, filtered to your configured
  domains).
- `models/staging/hackernews`: Hacker News stories. The model attaches the public
  Hacker News MotherDuck share before reading it:

  ```sql
  ATTACH IF NOT EXISTS 'md:_share/hacker_news/de11a0e3-9d68-48d2-ac44-40e07a1d496b' AS hacker_news;
  ```

- `models/intermediate`: target-domain joins and edge expansion.
- `models/marts`: tested tables ready to query, and the source the Dive reads.

The Dive lives in `dives/backlinks-hn/dive.tsx` and queries the mart tables. The
deploy script (`scripts/deploy-dive.sh`) reads `dives/<name>/dive-manifest.json`,
loads the `dive.tsx` source with DuckDB `read_text()`, substitutes the database
and `_mart` schema into the source, and creates or updates the Dive in MotherDuck
with the `MD_CREATE_DIVE` / `MD_UPDATE_DIVE_CONTENT` functions.

## Questions to answer

- Which target domain(s) should the link graph and HN coverage focus on (`commoncrawl_domains`)?
- Which MotherDuck database and base schema, and dev or prod (`DBT_DUCKDB_PATH`, `DBT_SCHEMA`, `--target`)?
- Which Common Crawl snapshot, and how many HN stories per domain (`commoncrawl_snapshot`, `hackernews_max_stories_per_domain`)?
- Is the large Common Crawl edges download acceptable (see Caveats), or should the scope be narrowed first?
- Deploy the Dive, and as a preview or to production?
- Is a MotherDuck account and token available, with access to the Hacker News share?

## Caveats

- The Common Crawl edges file is large (~14GB). `stg_commoncrawl__domain_edges` is materialized incrementally so it is not re-downloaded on every run; avoid a casual `--full-refresh` of that model.
- `DBT_DUCKDB_PATH` and `DBT_SCHEMA` must match between the dbt build and the Dive deploy. If they differ, the Dive points at a database/`_mart` schema that the build did not populate and renders empty.
- The Hacker News staging model attaches a MotherDuck share (`md:_share/hacker_news/...`); the run needs access to that share.
- `scripts/deploy-dive.sh` requires the `duckdb` CLI and `jq` on PATH and `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` set; it exits early if any are missing.
- The deploy expects a unique Dive title: if more than one Dive already shares the title it errors instead of guessing which to update. Use `PREVIEW_BRANCH` for non-production deploys.
- `threads: 24` in `profiles.yml` is aggressive; lower it for smaller machines or plans.

## What you'll adjust

| Setting | Purpose | Options / example |
|---|---|---|
| `commoncrawl_domains` (`dbt_project.yml` vars) | The target domains the link graph and HN stories are filtered to. | `[motherduck.com, duckdb.org]`; add your own domains |
| `commoncrawl_snapshot` (`dbt_project.yml` vars) | Which Common Crawl web-graph snapshot to read. | `cc-main-2026-jan-feb-mar` |
| `hackernews_max_stories_per_domain` (`dbt_project.yml` vars) | Cap on HN stories pulled per domain. | `100` |
| `DBT_DUCKDB_PATH` (env) | MotherDuck database dbt builds into. Must match the Dive deploy. | `md:my_db` (dev), `md:dbt_prod` (prod) |
| `DBT_SCHEMA` (env) | Base schema; models land in `<DBT_SCHEMA>_stg/_int/_mart`. Must match the Dive deploy. | `dbt_dev` (dev), `dbt_main` (prod) |
| dbt `--target` (`profiles.yml`) | Which profile output to use. | `dev` (default), `prod` |
| `threads` (`profiles.yml`) | dbt thread count. | `24`; lower it for smaller machines or plans |
| `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` (env) | MotherDuck access token for dbt and the Dive deploy. | a token from the MotherDuck UI |
| `dives/backlinks-hn/dive.tsx` + `dive-manifest.json` | The Dive's React/SQL source and its title/description. | edit tiles, queries, title |
| `PREVIEW_BRANCH` (env, deploy) | Appends a branch name to the Dive title so a preview does not overwrite production. | `$(git branch --show-current)` |

## Run it

Prerequisites: a MotherDuck account and access token, and `uv`. The Dive deploy
also needs the `duckdb` CLI and `jq` on your PATH.

```sh
uv sync
export MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN="..."

# Validate, then build the warehouse (dev target by default)
uv run dbt debug --profiles-dir .
uv run dbt parse --profiles-dir .
uv run dbt build --profiles-dir .
```

Domains are configured in `dbt_project.yml` under `commoncrawl_domains`; add more
domains there as needed. Create the target MotherDuck database first if it does
not already exist.

### Deploy the Dive

Build the dbt project first, then deploy the Dive. `DBT_DUCKDB_PATH` and
`DBT_SCHEMA` must match the values used for the build, because the deploy script
substitutes the database and `${DBT_SCHEMA}_mart` schema into the Dive source:

```sh
export MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN="..."
export DBT_DUCKDB_PATH="md:my_db"
export DBT_SCHEMA="dbt_dev"
uv run dbt build --profiles-dir .
./scripts/deploy-dive.sh backlinks-hn
```

For production, use your prod database and schema for both the build and deploy:

```sh
export DBT_DUCKDB_PATH="md:dbt_prod"
export DBT_SCHEMA="dbt_main"
uv run dbt build --target prod --profiles-dir .
./scripts/deploy-dive.sh backlinks-hn
```

For a preview that does not overwrite the production Dive, set `PREVIEW_BRANCH`;
the script appends the branch name to the Dive title:

```sh
PREVIEW_BRANCH="$(git branch --show-current)" ./scripts/deploy-dive.sh backlinks-hn
```

The script prints the deployed Dive URL.
