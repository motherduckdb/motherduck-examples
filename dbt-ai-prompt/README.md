# Extract Structured Data From Reviews With dbt And prompt()

This is a dbt-duckdb project that runs MotherDuck's `prompt()` AI function inside a model to extract structured fields from free-text product reviews. The pattern: a single SQL model passes each review's `title` and `text` to `prompt()` with a `struct` schema, MotherDuck returns typed columns (sentiment, pros, cons, product features, customer-service signals, and more), and downstream views aggregate those attributes per product. LLM extraction becomes just another dbt transformation, versioned and testable like any other model.

The source data is a sample Amazon "toys and games" reviews dataset that lives in the public MotherDuck share `webshop-dbt-md-ai`, so you can run the example end to end before pointing it at your own table.

## How it works

`models/reviews/reviews_attributes.sql` is the core model. It calls `prompt()` once per row with two arguments that do the heavy lifting:

- `struct` declares the output schema. Each key becomes a typed column on the result, so `prompt()` returns structured data instead of a blob of text. The example asks for 16 fields spanning sentiment, feature mentions, quality indicators (`has_size_info`, `mentions_price`, `mentions_shipping`, `mentions_packaging`), comparative analysis, usage context, reported issues, and customer-service signals.
- `struct_descr` gives a natural-language description per field. This is where you constrain values, for example telling the model that `sentiment` "can only take values `positive`, `neutral` or `negative`" and that list fields should "return empty array" when nothing matches.

The model then projects `prompt_struct_response.*` so the struct's fields land as flat columns alongside `parent_asin`:

```sql
select parent_asin, prompt_struct_response.*
from (
    select
        parent_asin,
        prompt(
            'You are a very helpful assistant. ...'
            || title
            || '...'
            || text,
            struct := {
                sentiment:'VARCHAR',
                product_features:'VARCHAR[]',
                pros:'VARCHAR[]',
                cons:'VARCHAR[]',
                mentions_price:'BOOLEAN',
                -- ...12 more fields...
            },
            struct_descr := {
                sentiment:'the sentiment of the review, can only take values `positive`, `neutral` or `negative`',
                -- ...one description per field...
            }
        ) as prompt_struct_response
    from (select * from {{ source('reviews', 'reviews_raw') }} limit 10)
)
```

Two views build on that table:

- `models/reviews/reviews_attributes_by_product.sql` unnests the array fields (`product_features`, `pros`, `cons`, `competitor_mentions`, `use_case`, `purchase_reason`, `reported_issues`, `quality_concerns`) and re-aggregates them into deduplicated arrays per product with `array_distinct(array_agg(...))`. The result is one row per `parent_asin` holding the distinct set of everything reviewers mentioned.
- `models/reviews/reviews_attributes_sentiment_by_product.sql` counts positive/neutral/negative sentiment per product and computes a normalized score, `(positive - negative) / total`, ranging from -1 to 1, for both overall reviews and customer-service interactions. `NULLIF(..., 0)` guards against divide-by-zero when a product has no scored rows.

## What you'll adjust

| Setting | Purpose | Options / example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `source('reviews', 'reviews_raw')` in `models/reviews/reviews_attributes.sql` | The input table of unstructured text to extract from | Point at your own reviews/feedback table |
| `database` / `schema` / `tables` in `models/reviews/_sources.yml` | Where the source data lives | Defaults to database `webshop-dbt-md-ai`, schema `main`, table `reviews_raw` |
| `limit 10` in `reviews_attributes.sql` | Caps how many rows are sent to `prompt()` (keeps cost and runtime small for a demo) | Raise or remove for a full run |
| The `prompt(...)` instruction text in `reviews_attributes.sql` | The extraction prompt, built by concatenating the `title` and `text` columns | Swap in your own column names and task |
| `struct` and `struct_descr` in `reviews_attributes.sql` | The output schema and per-field descriptions that shape the returned columns | Add/remove fields like `sentiment:'VARCHAR'`, `pros:'VARCHAR[]'`, `mentions_price:'BOOLEAN'` |
| `+database: my_db` under `models.dbt_ai_prompt.reviews` in `dbt_project.yml` | Target database materialized models are written to | Change `my_db` to a MotherDuck database you can write to |
| `+materialized: table` (dir default) / per-model `config(materialized=...)` | Materialization: the extraction model is a `table`, aggregates are `view` | `table`, `view`, `incremental` |
| `path: 'md:'` and `target: dev` in `profiles.yml` | Connection target for dbt | `md:` for MotherDuck, or a local `.duckdb` file path |
| `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` env var | Read/write auth for MotherDuck | A token from your MotherDuck account |
| `accepted_values` / `not_null` tests in `models/reviews/schema.yml` | Validate the extracted output (e.g. sentiment in positive/neutral/negative) | Adjust to your fields |

## Questions to answer

- What is the source table of unstructured text, and which columns hold the text to extract from?
- Which target MotherDuck database and schema should the models write to?
- What structured fields are wanted out, and what are the allowed values / types for each?
- Should this run on a sample (the `limit 10` demo) or the full table?
- Is there a `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` with read/write access to the target database?
- Is the source database created and populated (or, for the demo, is the `webshop-dbt-md-ai` share attached)?

## Run it

Prerequisites: a MotherDuck account and a read/write `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` set in your environment, plus access to the source database.

```sh
uv venv --python 3.13
uv pip install dbt-duckdb duckdb==1.4.3
source .venv/bin/activate

export MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN="your_token_here"

dbt run
dbt test
dbt show --select reviews_attributes_by_product
```

`dbt run` builds `reviews_attributes` (the `prompt()` extraction, as a table) plus the two aggregate views; `dbt test` runs the `not_null` and `accepted_values` checks in `schema.yml`. The `duckdb==1.4.3` pin matters: MotherDuck only accepts specific DuckDB client versions, and a mismatched local DuckDB will fail to connect.

The example reads `reviews_raw` from the public `webshop-dbt-md-ai` MotherDuck share. If your account does not already have it attached, attach it once:

```sql
ATTACH 'md:_share/webshop-dbt-md-ai/a8a01cac-c4e6-4de1-93bf-bcc4c54aa77f';
```

## Files

- [`dbt_project.yml`](dbt_project.yml) - dbt project config: names the project `dbt_ai_prompt`, sets standard path layout, and defaults `models/reviews` to materialize as `table` writing to database `my_db` (change this placeholder before running).
- [`profiles.yml`](profiles.yml) - the dbt connection profile: a single `dev` target using the `duckdb` adapter with `path: 'md:'` to connect to MotherDuck.
- [`models/reviews/reviews_attributes.sql`](models/reviews/reviews_attributes.sql) - the core model: calls `prompt()` once per review row with a `struct` and `struct_descr` to extract 16 typed fields, materialized as a table (`limit 10` caps the demo run).
- [`models/reviews/reviews_attributes_by_product.sql`](models/reviews/reviews_attributes_by_product.sql) - a view that unnests the array fields and re-aggregates them into deduplicated arrays per product.
- [`models/reviews/reviews_attributes_sentiment_by_product.sql`](models/reviews/reviews_attributes_sentiment_by_product.sql) - a view that counts positive/neutral/negative sentiment per product and computes a normalized score for both reviews and customer-service interactions.
- [`models/reviews/_sources.yml`](models/reviews/_sources.yml) - declares the `reviews` source: database `webshop-dbt-md-ai`, schema `main`, with tables including `reviews_raw`.
- [`models/reviews/schema.yml`](models/reviews/schema.yml) - model documentation and data tests: column descriptions plus `not_null` and `accepted_values` checks (e.g. `sentiment` must be positive/neutral/negative).
- [`analyses/`](analyses/), [`macros/`](macros/), [`seeds/`](seeds/), [`snapshots/`](snapshots/), [`tests/`](tests/) - the standard dbt project directories, empty placeholders here (each holds a `.gitkeep`).
- [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) - ignores dbt build output: `target/`, `dbt_packages/`, and `logs/`.

## Caveats

- Do not commit your `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN`. The repo ships an `.envrc` that exported a real token during development. Treat any token visible in version control as compromised, rotate it, and load tokens from your own environment or a secret manager instead of checking them in.
- `prompt()` runs once per input row and is billed and rate-limited as an AI call. The model ships with `limit 10` for exactly this reason. Removing the limit on a large table can be slow and costly, so size your run deliberately.
- LLM output is non-deterministic. Two `dbt run` invocations can return slightly different extractions, so do not rely on byte-stable results. Materializing `reviews_attributes` as a `table` (the default) freezes one run's output for the downstream views; re-running re-extracts.
- The `accepted_values` test on `sentiment` will fail if `prompt()` ever returns a value outside `positive`/`neutral`/`negative` (for example a capitalized or hedged answer). The `struct_descr` text is guidance, not a hard constraint. Keep the test as a guardrail and tighten the prompt wording, or normalize the column, if it trips.
- Change `+database: my_db` in `dbt_project.yml` before running. The placeholder `my_db` is not a real database; leave it and `dbt run` writes to (or fails to create) a database called `my_db`.
- The source must exist and be reachable. `_sources.yml` points at the `webshop-dbt-md-ai` share; if it is not attached, or your own source table is missing, dbt fails at compile/run time rather than silently producing empty output.
- Empty arrays vs nulls: list fields are instructed to return an empty array when nothing matches. `unnest` drops empty arrays, so products whose reviews mention nothing for a given field simply do not contribute rows in `reviews_attributes_by_product`. That is expected, not a bug.
