# Capture Vercel Log Drain Traffic and Classify AI Agents in MotherDuck

A single Vercel Function (`api/drain.ts`) is registered as a Vercel log drain endpoint. Vercel POSTs NDJSON batches of request logs to it; the function verifies the HMAC-SHA1 signature, parses each line, classifies it against the rules in `bots.yaml` (crawler, agent, or human-via-AI), drops static asset requests, and writes the whole batch in one `INSERT` to a native MotherDuck table. It connects directly with `@duckdb/node-api` using a MotherDuck token, and bootstraps the database, schema, table, and an `ai_requests` view on the first cold start. The MotherDuck pattern this shows: an edge collector that lands raw web traffic in a native table you can read live from a Dive or BI tool, with classification kept in code so you can reclassify history in SQL.

## Architecture

```
 Vercel app
     │
     │ NDJSON log drain (HMAC signed)
     ▼
 Vercel Function (api/drain)
     │  verify signature
     │  parse + classify UA / referer
     │  drop static assets
     │  one bulk INSERT per batch
     ▼
 MotherDuck  <MD_DESTINATION>.<MD_TABLE>
     │
     └──── Dive / BI tool reads the same table
```

Why this shape:

- **Log drain, not middleware**: captures every request at the edge without changing app code. Vercel handles batching and retries.
- **One batch, one round-trip**: each Vercel drain POST already carries roughly 100 to 1000 log lines. The function parses, classifies, and writes the whole batch in a single `INSERT`, with no cross-invocation buffering.
- **Static assets excluded**: image requests plus `.js`, `.css`, font files (`.woff`, `.woff2`, `.ttf`, `.otf`, `.eot`), and source maps are dropped before insert so the table stays focused on page and API traffic that matters for AI measurement.
- **Native MotherDuck table**: the simplest write path and the fastest reads. If you want open Parquet under the hood and snapshot isolation instead, see the DuckLake variant note in Caveats.
- **Classifier in code, rules in YAML**: `bots.yaml` is the source of truth for AI identification. Update it and redeploy; the raw payload is stored on every row so you can reclassify history in SQL.

## Security

- **HMAC verification is mandatory.** `src/signature.ts` recomputes HMAC-SHA1 of the raw body with `VERCEL_DRAIN_SECRET` and compares it with the `x-vercel-signature` header using a constant-time `timingSafeEqual`. A missing or mismatched signature returns `401` and nothing is written. The secret in the Vercel drain config must match `VERCEL_DRAIN_SECRET` exactly, otherwise every delivery is rejected.
- **Verification happens on the raw body before parsing.** Sign the unmodified body bytes; the local test script does this with `openssl dgst -sha1 -hmac`. Any middleware that re-serializes the body before it reaches the handler will break the signature.
- **The collector builds SQL by string concatenation, not bound parameters.** String values are escaped via `sqlStr` (doubling single quotes) and identifiers via `quoteIdent` (doubling double quotes), and `MD_DESTINATION` is validated to be exactly `<database>.<schema>`. This is the trust boundary that keeps log content from breaking out of the `INSERT`. If you add columns or new value types, route them through `sqlStr` / `sqlTs` / `quoteIdent`, do not interpolate raw strings.
- **Do not put secrets in `vercel.json` or commit them.** `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` and `VERCEL_DRAIN_SECRET` are read from the environment only.
- **Client IPs are anonymized by default.** `anonymizeIp` zeroes the last IPv4 octet (`203.0.113.42` becomes `203.0.113.0`) before insert. IPv6 and non-IPv4 strings pass through unchanged, so adjust the function if you need IPv6 handling or full IPs for a legitimate reason.

## How it works

- `src/signature.ts`: HMAC-SHA1 verification of the raw body, constant-time comparison.
- `src/handler.ts`: NDJSON and JSON-array parsing, field extraction from Vercel's `proxy.*` log shape (with fallbacks to flat fields and `request.headers.*`), static-asset filtering, IP anonymization, and `BOTS_ONLY` filtering. A single malformed NDJSON line is skipped rather than failing the whole batch.
- `src/classify.ts` + `bots.yaml`: substring matching that loads the YAML rules, user agent first then referer, first match wins. The raw payload is stored on every row so you can reclassify history in SQL.
- `src/db.ts`: the `@duckdb/node-api` connection (`md:` + token), idempotent schema bootstrap, and the multi-row bulk `INSERT`. The connection is module-scoped so warm invocations reuse it. `HOME` and the extension directory are pinned to a writable temp path because Vercel's Node runtime can present `HOME` as empty.
- `api/drain.ts`: the Vercel Function entry point (`POST` only, `405` otherwise); `src/local-server.ts` is the equivalent dev harness on `:8787`.
- `sql/01_setup.sql`: reference DDL for the table and `ai_requests` view (the function runs the same statements automatically on cold start).
- `sql/02_dive_queries.sql`: starter tiles you can save as a MotherDuck Dive (see below).

The function returns a `200 ok <n> of <total>` body so you can see how many rows of each batch were written after `BOTS_ONLY` and static-asset filtering.

## The classifier

`bots.yaml` is the source of truth, evaluated top to bottom, first match wins. Three categories:

- `crawler`: background training and indexing bots not tied to a user prompt (`GPTBot`, `OAI-SearchBot`, `ClaudeBot`, `Claude-SearchBot`, `Google-Extended`, `GoogleOther`, `CCBot`, `Applebot-Extended`, `Bytespider`, `Meta-ExternalAgent`, `PerplexityBot`, ...).
- `agent`: on-demand fetchers driven by a user prompt (`ChatGPT-User`, `ChatGPT Agent`, `Operator`, `Claude-User`, `Perplexity-User`, `MistralAI-User`, `Gemini-Deep-Research`, `Devin`, ...).
- `human_via_ai`: matched on `referer` for `chatgpt.com`, `claude.ai`, `perplexity.ai`, `gemini.google.com`, `copilot.microsoft.com`, `phind.com`, `meta.ai`, `chat.mistral.ai`, and more.

The list is seeded from the community-maintained [ai-robots-txt](https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt) catalog plus vendor docs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, Cloudflare, Dark Visitors). Edit the YAML and redeploy to update rules; no reingest is needed, because the raw user agent and referer are stored on every row. You can also reclassify historical rows in SQL against the `raw` JSON column.

## Build a Dive

Save `sql/02_dive_queries.sql` as a MotherDuck Dive. Each block is one tile:

- Live 5-minute AI request counter.
- Requests per minute by category, last 60 minutes.
- Top 20 AI agents by request count, last 24h (with 4xx and 5xx breakdown).
- Humans arriving via AI referers (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, ...).
- 404s hit by crawlers (content they wanted but could not find).
- Daily AI share of traffic, last 30 days.
- Top pages by AI category, last 24h.

The queries default to `agent_analytics.raw.vercel_request_logs`; if you changed `MD_DESTINATION` or `MD_TABLE`, update the identifiers in the file before saving it. For Dive authoring, sharing, and embedding, run the `get_dive_guide` MCP tool.

## When to turn on `BOTS_ONLY`

Start with `BOTS_ONLY=false` so you have a real baseline that includes human traffic: you can measure AI share of traffic, see which pages humans land on from AI UIs, and so on. Flip it to `true` once the table has grown large enough that dropping non-AI rows is worth it. Because the raw payload is not retained for dropped rows, you cannot recover human traffic after the fact, so keep the baseline long enough first.

## What you'll adjust

| Setting | Purpose | Options / example |
|---|---|---|
| `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` (env, required) | MotherDuck access token used by the DuckDB Node API connection | a token from the MotherDuck UI |
| `VERCEL_DRAIN_SECRET` (env, required) | HMAC secret to verify drain deliveries; paste the same value into the Vercel log drain config | any high-entropy string, e.g. `dev-secret` for local testing |
| `MD_DESTINATION` (env, optional) | Target database and schema in `<database>.<schema>` form | default `agent_analytics.raw`; e.g. `web_analytics.ingest` |
| `MD_TABLE` (env, optional) | Target table name | default `vercel_request_logs` |
| `MD_DATABASE` / `MD_SCHEMA` (env, optional) | Legacy split form of the destination, used only when `MD_DESTINATION` is unset | defaults `agent_analytics` / `raw` |
| `BOTS_ONLY` (env, optional) | When `true`, drop rows with no classifier match so only AI traffic is stored | default `false`; set `true` once you only care about AI traffic |
| `bots.yaml` (`user_agent_patterns`, `referer_patterns`) | Source of truth for AI classification; substring match on user agent then referer | add or edit `pattern` / `name` / `category` rows; categories are `crawler`, `agent`, `human_via_ai` |
| `IGNORED_PATH_EXTENSIONS` + `/_next/image` check (`src/handler.ts`) | Static asset paths dropped before insert | extend the extension set or path checks to filter more routes |
| `anonymizeIp` (`src/handler.ts`) | Zeroes the last IPv4 octet before insert | remove or change if you need full IPs or IPv6 handling |
| `maxDuration` / `includeFiles` (`vercel.json`) | Function timeout and which non-code files get bundled | `maxDuration: 30`; `includeFiles: "bots.yaml"` |
| `PORT` (env, local only) | Port for the local dev harness `src/local-server.ts` | default `8787` |

## Questions to answer

- Which Vercel project's traffic should be captured, and is there permission to create a log drain on it?
- Target MotherDuck database and schema (`MD_DESTINATION`) and table name (`MD_TABLE`).
- All traffic for a baseline, or AI-only (`BOTS_ONLY`)? Start with all traffic, see "When to turn on BOTS_ONLY".
- Which AI crawlers, agents, and AI referers matter, so `bots.yaml` can be tuned.
- Should client IPs be anonymized (the default) or kept in full.
- Where the MotherDuck token and the shared drain secret will be stored as Vercel environment variables (never commit them to `vercel.json` or the repo).

## Run it

Prerequisites: a MotherDuck account and access token, a Vercel project with log drain creation rights, and Node 20+.

Local dev (no deploy):

```bash
npm install
export VERCEL_DRAIN_SECRET=dev-secret
export MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN=...
npm run dev            # starts src/local-server.ts on :8787
./scripts/test-local.sh   # signs and POSTs scripts/sample-payload.ndjson
```

Type check:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Deploy the function to Vercel:

```bash
npm install
vercel                 # deploy; prints https://<project>.vercel.app/api/drain
```

Then in the Vercel project settings:

1. Set `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` and `VERCEL_DRAIN_SECRET` (plus any optional knobs above) as environment variables.
2. Under Settings : Log Drains : Add, create an `NDJSON` drain pointing at the `/api/drain` URL, using the same custom secret as `VERCEL_DRAIN_SECRET`.

The function creates the database, schema, table, and `ai_requests` view on the first request, so there is no manual SQL step. Verify against the deployed endpoint:

```bash
./scripts/test-local.sh https://<project>.vercel.app/api/drain
```

Then query MotherDuck (adjust to your configured destination and table):

```sql
SELECT * FROM agent_analytics.raw.vercel_request_logs
ORDER BY event_ts DESC LIMIT 20;
```

## Files

- [`api/drain.ts`](api/drain.ts) - the Vercel Function entry point: reads the raw POST body, pulls the `x-vercel-signature` header, hands off to `handleDrain`, returns `405` for non-POST.
- [`src/`](src/) - the collector logic in five TypeScript modules: `handler.ts` (NDJSON parse, field extraction, static-asset and `BOTS_ONLY` filtering, IP anonymization), `signature.ts` (constant-time HMAC-SHA1 verification of the raw body), `classify.ts` (substring matching against `bots.yaml`), `db.ts` (the `@duckdb/node-api` connection, schema bootstrap, bulk `INSERT`), and `local-server.ts` (the local dev harness on `:8787`).
- [`bots.yaml`](bots.yaml) - the AI classification rules, the source of truth: `user_agent_patterns` and `referer_patterns` with `pattern` / `name` / `category` (`crawler`, `agent`, `human_via_ai`), evaluated top to bottom, first match wins.
- [`sql/01_setup.sql`](sql/01_setup.sql) - reference DDL for the table and the `ai_requests` view; the function runs the same statements automatically on cold start.
- [`sql/02_dive_queries.sql`](sql/02_dive_queries.sql) - starter tiles you can save as a MotherDuck Dive (AI request counters, top agents, AI-referred humans, crawler 404s, daily AI share).
- [`scripts/test-local.sh`](scripts/test-local.sh) - signs `sample-payload.ndjson` with `VERCEL_DRAIN_SECRET` and POSTs it to the local or deployed endpoint, the same way Vercel signs a real delivery.
- [`scripts/sample-payload.ndjson`](scripts/sample-payload.ndjson) - eight example Vercel log lines (crawlers, agents, AI referers, a human) used by the test script.
- [`vercel.json`](vercel.json) - the Vercel Function config: `maxDuration: 30` and `includeFiles: "bots.yaml"` so the classifier rules get bundled.
- [`package.json`](package.json) - dependencies (`@duckdb/node-api`, `yaml`) and scripts (`dev`, `typecheck`); `package-lock.json` pins the lockfile.
- [`tsconfig.json`](tsconfig.json) - strict TypeScript config (ES2022, ESNext modules) covering `api/` and `src/`.

## Caveats

- **Cold start**: the first invocation after idle pays a roughly 500 ms to 1 s MotherDuck extension load. Vercel Fluid Compute keeps functions warm well enough that this is rare in practice. For high-QPS sites, ping the function every few minutes or enable always-warm via Vercel's Fluid config.
- **`HOME` can be empty on Vercel**: MotherDuck needs a writable extension cache. `src/db.ts` pins `HOME` and `DUCKDB_EXTENSION_DIRECTORY` to a temp path; if you change that code, keep it writable or the connection fails silently on cold start.
- **Bundle size**: `@duckdb/node-api` ships a native binary. Fluid Compute gives you the headroom; classic Serverless Functions may hit the 50 MB zipped limit.
- **No appender on native MotherDuck tables (yet)**: the example uses a multi-row `INSERT` instead. With roughly 500 rows per batch that is one network round-trip per drain POST, which is plenty fast. If you need the appender path or open Parquet storage with snapshot isolation, build the DuckLake variant of this collector instead (run `ask_docs_question` for DuckLake).
- **At-least-once delivery**: on a 5xx response Vercel redelivers the batch, and the handler deliberately returns `503` on a failed write so Vercel retries. If you care about exact counts, dedupe on `event_id` in your queries.
- **Agentic browsers that spoof user agents**: the classifier only sees what the bot tells it. AI agents using plain Chromium UAs fall into the `null` bucket and are counted as human unless their referer matches.
- **`bots.yaml` must be bundled**: `vercel.json` sets `includeFiles: "bots.yaml"`. If you remove that, `src/classify.ts` throws "bots.yaml not found" at cold start and the function fails.
- **Don't sign or transform the body before the handler**: signature verification runs on the raw bytes. Any body rewrite breaks the HMAC check and every delivery returns `401`.
- **`INSERT` column order is load-bearing**: the value tuples in `src/db.ts` must match the `CREATE TABLE` order in `sql/01_setup.sql`. Adding a column means editing both, in the same order.
- **`MD_DESTINATION` parsing is strict**: it must be exactly `<database>.<schema>` with two non-empty parts, or the function throws at cold start. A bare database name or a three-part name is rejected.
