  An admin Flight that reads a users control table and provisions one isolated

# Provision User Databases and Shares

A single-file admin Flight that turns a control table of users into per-user
MotherDuck resources. It shows the MotherDuck pattern for tenant-style
provisioning: read `(email, segment, active)` rows, give each active user an
isolated database and a restricted share, grant read access, and revoke access
when a user is marked inactive. A ledger records what each run did.

This creates account-level databases and shares, so treat it as an admin
workflow, not a disposable demo. It defaults to **`DRY_RUN=true`**: the first run
seeds a demo control table, logs the exact provisioning plan, and writes the
ledger without creating any databases, shares, or grants. Replace the demo users
with real MotherDuck usernames and set `DRY_RUN=false` to provision for real.

Everything is driven by Flight config, so you adapt it by setting config values,
not by editing `flight.py`.

## What you'll adjust

Every knob is a config/env value read at the top of `flight.py`. Set them as
Flight config, not by editing code.

| Config key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DRY_RUN` | `true` | When true, log the plan and write the ledger without creating databases, shares, or grants. Set `false` to provision for real. |
| `PROVISION_DATABASE` | `flights_demo` | Database holding the users control table and the ledger. Created if missing. Validated as a SQL identifier. |
| `PROVISION_SCHEMA` | `main` | Schema for the control and ledger tables. Validated as a SQL identifier. |
| `USERS_TABLE` | `flight_users` | Control table of `(email, segment, active)`. Seeded with demo rows on the first run if missing. Validated as a SQL identifier. |
| `LEDGER_TABLE` | `user_database_map` | Audit table recording what each run did per user. Validated as a SQL identifier. |
| `DATABASE_PREFIX` | `user_dw_` | Prefix for each per-user database (`<prefix><email-slug>`). Validated as a SQL identifier. |
| `SHARE_SUFFIX` | `_share` | Suffix for each per-user share (`<database><suffix>`). Validated as a SQL identifier. |
| `USER_SCHEMA` | `app` | Schema created inside each user database for the profile table. Validated as a SQL identifier. |
| `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` | (Flight-injected) | Auth. Use an admin or service account token allowed to create databases and shares and to grant/revoke. Never put it in config. |

## Questions to answer

- Which control table lists the users, and does it have `email`, `segment`, and `active` columns (`USERS_TABLE`, `PROVISION_DATABASE`, `PROVISION_SCHEMA`)?
- Are the `email` values valid MotherDuck usernames in the same sharing scope?
- How should per-user databases and shares be named (`DATABASE_PREFIX`, `SHARE_SUFFIX`)?
- What does each user's database need beyond the demo profile table (`USER_SCHEMA` plus your own tables)?
- Which admin or service account token should own the created resources?
- Run on demand, or on a schedule once the control table is trusted?
- Validating the plan first (`DRY_RUN=true`), or ready to provision for real (`DRY_RUN=false`)?

## Run it

You need a MotherDuck account and a token allowed to create databases and shares
and to grant or revoke share access. Prefer a service account token so the
created resources do not depend on a person's account lifecycle.

To see the plan locally without creating anything, run the file directly. With
the default `DRY_RUN=true` it seeds the demo control table, logs the plan, and
writes the ledger:

```bash
export MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN=your_token_here
uv run --with duckdb==1.5.2 flight.py
```

Once the control table holds real usernames, provision for real:

```bash
DRY_RUN=false uv run --with duckdb==1.5.2 flight.py
```

### Deploy as a Flight

Deploy with the MotherDuck MCP server rather than checked-in SQL. Call
`get_flight_guide` first for the exact tool arguments, then `create_flight` with:

- `source_code`: the contents of [`flight.py`](flight.py)
- `requirements_txt`: the contents of [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)
- `access_token_name`: an admin or service account token name (list them with the
  `md_access_tokens()` table function); the runtime injects its value as
  `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN`
- `config`: the keys from [What you'll adjust](#what-youll-adjust) you want to
  override (omit any you are keeping at default)

Create the Flight without a schedule, trigger one manual run with `run_flight`
while `DRY_RUN` is `true`, and read the ledger and run logs to confirm the plan.
Then point `USERS_TABLE` at real usernames (or replace the seeded demo rows), set
`DRY_RUN=false`, and run again to provision. Add a schedule by updating the
Flight's `schedule_cron` only once you trust the control table; schedule updates
are metadata-only and do not create a new Flight version.

## How it works

`flight.py` runs a fixed sequence; the config values only change its inputs:

1. Connect to MotherDuck (`md:`), create `PROVISION_DATABASE` and its schema, seed
   the demo control table if it does not exist, and create the ledger table.
2. Read the users ordered by email.
3. For each **active** user, derive `DATABASE_PREFIX + slug(email)` and create the
   database, a `USER_SCHEMA` schema, and a `profile` table, then create a
   restricted share (`ACCESS RESTRICTED, VISIBILITY HIDDEN, UPDATE AUTOMATIC`) and
   grant read access to the username.
4. For each **inactive** user, revoke read access on that user's share.
5. Append one ledger row per user, including whether the run was a dry run.

When `DRY_RUN` is true, steps 3 and 4 only log the intended action; the ledger
still records the plan, so you can review exactly what a live run would do.

## Caveats

- **These are account-level resources.** The databases and shares are visible
  beyond `PROVISION_DATABASE`. Treat this as an admin workflow with a scoped token.
- **`DRY_RUN` defaults to true on purpose.** A first deploy never creates shares
  for placeholder users. Replace the seeded demo users with real MotherDuck
  usernames before setting `DRY_RUN=false`.
- **Deprovisioning is revoke-only.** Inactive users lose share access, but their
  database is not dropped. Dropping user databases is a separate policy decision.
- **Usernames must be valid.** A grant or revoke for an address that is not a
  MotherDuck user in the same sharing scope is skipped and logged, not fatal, so
  one bad row does not stop the run.
- **Re-running is idempotent for resources, not the ledger.** Active users use
  `IF NOT EXISTS`/`OR REPLACE`, but the ledger appends one row per user per run.
- **Keep the token out of config.** Select a token on the Flight so
  `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` is injected at runtime; do not place it in `config`.

## Security

- **Scoped admin token.** Use a token allowed only to create databases and shares
  and to grant/revoke, ideally a service account that owns the created resources.
- **Identifier validation.** Config-supplied names (`PROVISION_DATABASE`,
  `PROVISION_SCHEMA`, `USERS_TABLE`, `LEDGER_TABLE`, `DATABASE_PREFIX`,
  `SHARE_SUFFIX`, `USER_SCHEMA`) are checked against `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$`
  before any SQL runs.
- **Quoted dynamic identifiers.** Per-user database, share, schema, and username
  values are derived at runtime and quoted with `ident()`, which escapes embedded
  double quotes, since they cannot be parameterized.
- **Parameterized data.** The `email` and `segment` values are bound as parameters
  in the profile table and the ledger insert, never string-formatted into SQL.
