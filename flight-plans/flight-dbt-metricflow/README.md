# Query dbt MetricFlow Metrics as a Flight

A single-file Flight that builds a [dbt MetricFlow](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/about-metricflow)
semantic model on MotherDuck and queries it. It downloads a pinned dbt project as
a GitHub archive over HTTPS at run time. Flight config chooses the metric,
grouping, and date window for each run. Each run appends its result to a snapshot
table, so a scheduled Flight builds a queryable time series of metric values.

This is the Flight counterpart to the local [dbt-metricflow](../../dbt-metricflow)
example. There, `mf query` prints to your terminal; here the same semantic model
runs in a scheduled, torn-down container and its output has to land somewhere
durable.

## How it works

A Flight runs as a single `flight.py` in a fresh container that ships **no git
binary**. Embedding a copy of the dbt project would drift from the canonical
example, so `flight.py` **downloads the project over HTTPS at run time** (stdlib
only — no clone) and shells out to the `dbt` and `mf` CLIs against it:

1. Read the query settings from the environment. Flight `config` keys arrive as
   environment variables.
2. Connect to MotherDuck (`md:`) and `CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS` the target.
3. Download the pinned repository commit as a gzip archive into a temp directory
   and extract it.
   Public vs private is decided at run time: with no `GIT_TOKEN` secret it uses the
   public `…/archive/<ref>.tar.gz` endpoint; with one it uses the authenticated
   GitHub API tarball endpoint (`api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/tarball/<ref>`).
4. Discover the dbt project (`dbt_project.yml`) and the profile (`profiles.yml`)
   in the checkout by globbing, so any layout works.
5. Produce the semantic manifest `mf query` needs. With `BUILD_MODELS = True`
   (default) the Flight owns the build. `dbt seed` and `dbt run --target
   motherduck` materialize the tables. With `BUILD_MODELS = False`, the Flight
   runs `dbt parse` and expects a separate dbt job to have built the tables. The
   Flight still creates its target database if needed and appends query results.
   The fetched project's own `profiles.yml` is used as-is; its MotherDuck path
   reads the database name from `MD_DATABASE` via dbt's `env_var()`, so nothing is
   written from scratch.
6. `mf query --metrics … --group-by … --start-time … --end-time …`, writing a CSV.
7. Append each result row to the snapshot table, tagged with `run_at` and config.

```
query config ── download pinned archive ── dbt seed/run ── mf query ── snapshot table
per-run values       fixed source commit      build on MotherDuck     append, JSON, run_at
```

### The config-override pattern

This is the reason the Flight exists. A Flight's `config` is a `MAP(VARCHAR, VARCHAR)`
of non-secret values, injected as environment variables. You override it **per
run** without editing or re-versioning the Flight:

```sql
-- create once with default config
FROM MD_CREATE_FLIGHT(
  name := 'dbt_metricflow',
  source_code := '...flight.py...',
  requirements_txt := '...requirements.txt...',
  config := MAP {
    'METRICS': 'revenue,orders,customers',
    'GROUP_BY': 'metric_time__month',
    'START_DATE': '2024-01-01',
    'END_DATE': '2024-12-31'
  }
);

-- run with a one-off override: a different metric and window, same Flight
FROM MD_RUN_FLIGHT(
  flight_id := '…',
  config := MAP {'METRICS': 'revenue_per_customer', 'START_DATE': '2024-02-01', 'END_DATE': '2024-02-29'}
);
```

The override is merged over the stored config — provided keys win, omitted keys
keep the Flight default. **Keys must already exist on the Flight**; a per-run
override changes values, it cannot introduce a new key.

### The snapshot table

`mf query` output columns change with the metric and grouping you ask for, so a
fixed-column table would break the first time someone overrides `METRICS`. Each
result row is therefore stored as a `JSON` column, keeping one table usable across
every run:

```sql
SELECT run_at, metrics, group_by, result
FROM ecommerce_metrics_flight.metric_snapshots
ORDER BY run_at DESC;

-- pull a field back out of the JSON
SELECT run_at, result->>'revenue' AS revenue
FROM ecommerce_metrics_flight.metric_snapshots
WHERE metrics = 'revenue,orders,customers';
```

Verified across two runs: a `revenue,orders,customers` run and a
`revenue_per_customer` override produce different JSON shapes yet coexist in the
one table, each tagged with the config that produced it.

### Querying your own model

`PROJECT_REPO`, `PROJECT_REF`, and `PROJECT_SUBDIR` in `flight.py` point at this
cookbook's [dbt-metricflow](../../dbt-metricflow) example. `PROJECT_REF` is an
immutable commit SHA. To query your own metrics, change those constants and deploy
a new Flight version. Your project needs a `profiles.yml` with a `motherduck`
target whose path resolves the database. The example uses `path: "md:{{
env_var('MD_DATABASE', 'ecommerce_test_db') }}"`, which the Flight sets from its
`MD_DATABASE` constant.

### When a separate dbt job owns the build

`mf query` needs two things: the project's **parsed semantic manifest**
(`target/semantic_manifest.json`) and the **materialized tables** in the
warehouse. Only the manifest must be produced by this Flight — the tables just
have to exist. `dbt seed`/`dbt run` materialize them, but so does any other job.

If a separate dbt job already builds the models into MotherDuck, set
`BUILD_MODELS = False` in `flight.py` and deploy a new version. The Flight then
runs `dbt parse` to create the manifest locally, and `mf query` reads the tables
that the other job built. This avoids rebuilding the models and avoids replacing
real fact tables with the demo seed. It does not make the Flight read-only. The
Flight can create the target database and always appends query results to its
snapshot table. Point `PROJECT_REPO` and `PROJECT_REF` at the same project version
as the dbt job so the semantic definitions match the tables.

### Private repositories

A public repo needs no credentials. For a **private** GitHub repo, store a
personal access token (fine-grained, **Contents: Read-only** on that repo) in a
MotherDuck `TYPE flights` secret with a `GIT_TOKEN` param:

```sql
CREATE SECRET git_auth IN motherduck (
  TYPE flights,
  GIT_TOKEN 'github_pat_...'
);
```

`resolve_secret('GIT_TOKEN')` in `flight.py` reads it at run time — the Flight
injects each secret param as `<secret_name>_GIT_TOKEN`, and the helper accepts
either that or a bare `GIT_TOKEN` env var (handy locally). When a token is present,
the Flight switches to the authenticated GitHub API archive endpoint and sends the
token in an `Authorization` header (never in the URL, so it stays out of the logs).

## Questions to answer

- Which repository commit and subdirectory hold the dbt project?
- Which metrics matter, and what dimension and date window should each run query?
- Which target database should hold the built models and the snapshot table?
- Will runs vary the metric per trigger (config override), run on a fixed
  schedule, or both?
- Does the project's time spine range cover your requested dates?

## Caveats

- **Run-time network, no git.** The Flight downloads the project archive over
  HTTPS at run time (stdlib only — the container has no `git`), so it needs egress
  to GitHub. The archive endpoints are **GitHub-specific**; a non-GitHub host
  (GitLab, Bitbucket, self-hosted) would need a different fetch.
- **A private repo needs a `GIT_TOKEN` secret.** Without one, the public
  `…/archive/<ref>.tar.gz` URL 404s on a private repo. Store a token in a `TYPE
  flights` secret (see [Private repositories](#private-repositories)); the Flight
  then uses the authenticated API endpoint.
- **Override changes values, not keys.** A per-run `config` override only sets new
  values for keys that already exist on the Flight. This template exposes only
  query settings through config.
- **Time-dimension queries are bounded by the spine.** The example spine generates
  `2024-01-01` to `2025-12-31`. `START_DATE`/`END_DATE` outside that window, or
  grouping by `metric_time__*` beyond it, returns no rows. Widen the spine in your
  project.
- **The build runs every time, and concurrent builds conflict.** With
  `BUILD_MODELS = True`, each run does `dbt seed` + `dbt run` against the same
  database, so a large project is slower and **parallel runs collide** on the
  shared tables (MotherDuck rejects the losers with a write-write conflict). For
  a separate dbt job, set `BUILD_MODELS = False` to run `dbt parse` before the
  query (see
  [When a separate dbt job owns the build](#when-a-separate-dbt-job-owns-the-build)).
- **Derived metrics reference metric names, not measures.** `revenue_per_customer`
  is `revenue / customers`, both metrics. A raw measure name in a derived `expr`
  will not resolve.
- **Keep the token out of config.** The runtime attaches a MotherDuck token and
  injects it as `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN`; never place a token in `config`.

## What you'll adjust

`read_config()` reads only the query settings. Set those settings as Flight config
and override them with `MD_RUN_FLIGHT`. Change the source, destination, or build
mode constants in `flight.py`, then deploy a new Flight version.

| Config key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `METRICS` | `revenue,orders,customers` | Comma-separated metric(s) `mf query` computes. Override per run. |
| `GROUP_BY` | `metric_time__month` | Dimension(s) to slice by, e.g. `metric_time__day`, `order_id__status`. |
| `START_DATE` | `2024-01-01` | `mf query --start-time`; must fall inside the time spine. |
| `END_DATE` | `2024-12-31` | `mf query --end-time`; must fall inside the time spine. |

`PROJECT_REPO`, `PROJECT_REF`, `PROJECT_SUBDIR`, `BUILD_MODELS`, `MD_DATABASE`,
and `SNAPSHOT_TABLE` are constants in `flight.py`. `GIT_TOKEN` is a secret, not a
config key. Store it in a `TYPE flights` secret (see [Private repositories](#private-repositories))
so it never lands in the Flight's `config` map or logs.

## Run it

You need a MotherDuck account and an access token. The default repo/ref make a
fresh deploy produce a successful run with no other credentials.

Smoke-test locally before deploying (this downloads the project over HTTPS, builds
it in your account, and appends one batch to `metric_snapshots`):

```bash
export MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN=your_token_here
uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt flight.py
```

Override a query setting inline. To use another dbt project, change the
`PROJECT_*` constants and deploy a new Flight version. For a private repository,
set `GIT_TOKEN` as a bare environment variable locally. A deployed Flight reads it
from a Flights secret.

```bash
METRICS=revenue_per_customer GROUP_BY=metric_time__month \
  uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt flight.py
```

### Deploy as a Flight

Create the Flight with `MD_CREATE_FLIGHT` (no deploy SQL is checked in; adapt the
arguments), passing:

- `name`: a Flight name, for example `dbt_metricflow`
- `source_code`: the contents of [`flight.py`](flight.py)
- `requirements_txt`: the contents of [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)
- `config`: `METRICS`, `GROUP_BY`, `START_DATE`, and `END_DATE`

A MotherDuck token is attached automatically and injected at run time as
`MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN`; no token argument is needed. For a private dbt repo, also
`CREATE SECRET … (TYPE flights, GIT_TOKEN '…')` first (see
[Private repositories](#private-repositories)) — the Flight injects it at run time.

Create the Flight without a schedule first, trigger one manual run with
`MD_RUN_FLIGHT(flight_id := …)` (the id is returned by `MD_CREATE_FLIGHT` and
listed by `MD_FLIGHTS()`), and confirm the database and a `metric_snapshots` row
appear. Trigger a second run with a per-run `config` override to confirm the
override reaches the query (a different metric or window shows up in the new
snapshot row). Once green, add a schedule (`0 6 * * *`, 06:00 UTC daily, is a
reasonable default) by updating `schedule_cron` with `MD_UPDATE_FLIGHT`; schedule
updates are metadata-only and do not create a new version.

## Security

- **Identifier safety.** `MD_DATABASE` and `SNAPSHOT_TABLE` flow into `CREATE`
  statements that cannot be parameterized, so each is double-quote-escaped (`_ident`)
  before any SQL runs.
- **Parameterized data.** The snapshot row (metrics, grouping, dates, and the
  result JSON) is written with bound parameters, never string-formatted into SQL.
- **Pinned source.** The Flight downloads the repository commit in
  `PROJECT_REF`. Per-run config cannot change the code it downloads. Change a
  `PROJECT_*` constant and deploy a new version to adopt another source.
- **Token in a secret, in the header.** A private repo's `GIT_TOKEN` belongs in a
  `TYPE flights` secret, never in `config` (which is logged and stored on the
  Flight). At run time the token is sent in the `Authorization` header of the
  GitHub API request, not in the URL, so it does not reach the Flight logs.
