"""Render a MotherDuck Dive in headless Chromium and deliver the PNG + PDF.

Dives have no native PDF export yet, so this Flight mints a Dive embed session,
opens it in headless Chromium on MotherDuck compute, and captures a PNG and a
single-page PDF. The renditions are stored in MotherDuck as BLOBs and handed to
whichever delivery targets `DELIVERY` names.

Every knob is a config value or an env var; see the README "What you'll adjust"
table. Credentials arrive as Flight secret params under their bare names.
