# Export a Dive to PDF and Deliver It

Dives have no native PDF or PNG export yet. This single-file Flight builds one
out of the pieces that already exist: a Dive embed session, headless Chromium
running on MotherDuck compute, and a MotherDuck table to keep the results in.
Each run renders the Dive as it looks to a service account, captures a
full-height PNG and a single-page PDF, appends both to `STORE_TABLE` as BLOBs,
and hands them to whatever `DELIVERY` names. Put it on a cron and the report
arrives on its own.

A first run takes roughly 95 seconds, most of it the one-off Chromium download;
later runs on a warm image are much quicker.

## How it works

`flight.py` runs a fixed sequence, and every input is a config value:

1. `POST /v1/dives/{DIVE_ID}/embed-session` with `{"username": SERVICE_ACCOUNT}`
   mints a 24-hour embed session for the Dive. Each run mints its own, so there
   is nothing to refresh.
2. `playwright install chromium` pulls the browser into the Flight container.
   The image ships without one, which is what makes the first run slow.
3. Chromium opens the session URL at `VIEWPORT` and waits for the Dive to
   finish loading: at least `MIN_WAIT_MS`, then until the DOM stops changing,
   giving up at `WAIT_MS`. Set `WAIT_FOR_TEXT` to key on real content instead.
   See [Waiting for the Dive](#waiting-for-the-dive).
4. It stretches the viewport to the Dive's own scroll height, then captures a
   PNG at `SCALE` and a PDF on a single page of the same size, so no chart is
   cut in half. See [Sizing](#sizing).
5. Each rendition named in `ATTACH` is appended to `STORE_TABLE`
   (`captured_at`, `label`, `source_url`, `kind`, `filename`, `mime`,
   `byte_count`, `content`). The database and schema are created on first run.
6. Every target named in `DELIVERY` gets the same renditions. Delivery runs
   after the store, so a broken webhook still leaves the file somewhere you can
   reach it. `DELIVERY=""` stores and stops.

`DELIVERY`, `ATTACH`, `STORE_TABLE`, and the delivery credentials are all
validated before Chromium starts, so a typo or a missing secret fails the run in
seconds instead of after a 90-second render.

The Dive is rendered *as the service account*, so the export contains exactly
what that account is allowed to read. Grant it read access on the databases the
Dive queries and nothing else.

## Questions to answer

- Which Dive is being exported, and what is its id (the UUID in the Dive URL)?
- Which service account renders it, and does it have read access to everything
  the Dive queries?
- Is the PDF, the PNG, or both wanted?
- What layout width should the Dive be rendered at (see [Sizing](#sizing))?
- Which database holds the exports, and who is allowed to read that table?
- Where should the report land: a Slack channel, a Teams channel, a mailbox, the
  exports table, or several of those?
- For Teams, is there an Entra app registration to use, and who can grant it
  admin consent?
- What schedule (cron, UTC) matches how often the underlying data changes?

## Caveats

- **A service account is required.** `embed-session` rejects a regular user
  account with a generic `404 entity not found`. Create one with the REST API
  (see [Run it](#run-it)) before deploying.
- **The Flight's token must be able to mint embed sessions.** That means a
  read/write token on an account with the admin permission; a read-scaling or
  read-only token fails the API call.
- **A Dive scrolls inside its own frame**, so `full_page` on its own stops at
  the fold. The Flight measures the Dive's scroll container and grows the
  viewport to match before capturing, up to 30000px. Past that the capture is
  short, and the log says so on a `WARNING:` line. See [Sizing](#sizing).
- **The exports table grows.** Each run appends a few MB of BLOBs. Prune it on a
  schedule (`DELETE FROM ... WHERE captured_at < now() - INTERVAL 90 DAY`) or set
  `STORE_TABLE = ""` once delivery is enough.
- **A failed render does not raise on its own.** An expired or wrong session
  loads fine as far as Chromium is concerned; the sandbox just paints "Unable to
  load Dive", and that page would store and mail like any other. The Flight
  counts elements before going further (9 on that page against 539 on a loaded
  one) and fails the run instead, quoting what the page said. Lower
  `MIN_ELEMENTS`, or set it to `0`, if a genuinely sparse Dive trips it.
- **Queries run on MotherDuck, not in the container.** The session URL carries
  `queryMode=server`, so the Dive goes through the Postgres endpoint instead of
  spinning up DuckDB-wasm inside Chromium. That halved load time on the test
  Dive (roughly 8s to 4s) and keeps the Flight's memory use down. A session
  without a `pgEndpoint` falls back to wasm on its own.
- **Expect noisy logs on a successful run.** `Incomplete gRPC response no
  trailer transmitted` and `unassociated response: [undefined, MD_EVENT]` show up
  on every healthy render. So do Content Security Policy console errors from
  third-party scripts. None of them mean the capture failed; check the reported
  PNG and PDF byte counts instead.
- **Slack needs a bot token, not a webhook.** Incoming webhooks cannot carry a
  file. Delivery uses a bot token with `files:write`, and the bot has to be a
  member of the target channel or the upload is rejected with `not_in_channel`.
- **Teams delivery takes two hops.** No Teams webhook can carry a file, and
  posting a channel message with an app-only token is restricted to migration
  scenarios. So the file goes into the SharePoint folder behind the channel
  through Microsoft Graph (it appears in the channel's **Files** tab) and the
  optional `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` posts a card that links to it. Without the
  webhook the file still lands, it is just not announced.
- **A failing target does not block the others.** Every target in `DELIVERY` is
  attempted; each failure is logged on its own line and the run ends FAILED
  naming the targets that broke, so an expired token is visible without hiding
  the deliveries that worked.
- **Mail servers cap attachment size.** Most sit around 25 MB, and because the
  capture grows to the full height of the Dive, a long one at `SCALE=2` can
  approach that. Send `ATTACH=pdf` only, or drop `SCALE` to `1.5`, if mail
  bounces on size. The log reports both byte counts on every run.
- **Waiting for the Dive is a heuristic unless you make it one.** There is no
  "queries finished" signal to key on, so the Flight waits out `MIN_WAIT_MS` and
  then watches for the DOM to go quiet. That is a guess, and a Dive slower than
  its skeleton is deceptive (see [Waiting for the
  Dive](#waiting-for-the-dive)). `WAIT_FOR_TEXT` removes the guess.

## Waiting for the Dive

Nothing in the embed tells you the Dive has finished loading. `networkidle`
never fires, because the client holds connections open (measured: the in-flight
request count never reaches zero). The hosted sandbox exposes no "connected"
attribute either.

Watching the DOM go quiet is the obvious fallback, and on its own it is a trap.
A Dive paints a skeleton whose shape then sits *perfectly* still while the
queries run. On the Dive used to build this recipe:

| Time | Elements | Characters | Content height |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.3s to 7.3s | 65 | 321 | 1000px (nothing yet) |
| 8.8s | 539 | 3118 | 2586px (loaded) |

Six seconds of a motionless skeleton. A plain "unchanged for three polls" check
captures that and reports success, which is why `MIN_WAIT_MS` (15s) exists: DOM
quiet is only believed once it has passed. Raise it for a Dive whose first
query is slow.

For a report you actually depend on, set **`WAIT_FOR_TEXT`** instead. Give it a
string that appears only once the Dive has real data (a table footer, a total, a
column header that renders after the query), and the wait keys on that. It is
the only fully reliable signal here, and it fails the run rather than delivering
a half-rendered export:

```
WAIT_FOR_TEXT = "SHOWING 32 OF 32 TICKETS"
```

This is the same contract MotherDuck's own scheduled Dive-screenshot workflows
use. The trade-off is that the string is per-Dive: if the Dive is redesigned,
update it, or the run starts failing.

## Sizing

`VIEWPORT` is the layout width and the *minimum* height, not a ceiling. The
Flight lays the Dive out at that size, measures how tall it actually came out,
and grows the viewport to fit before capturing, so the whole Dive lands in the
shot without you having to guess its height.

Width still matters, because it decides the layout the Dive responds into:
`1440` is a good desktop default. Height only matters as a floor, for a short
Dive you want rendered on a taller canvas. `SCALE` is the PNG pixel ratio: `2`
is crisp, `1.5` halves the file size.

## What you'll adjust

Everything is a Flight config value (or an env var for a local run). Nothing has
to be edited in the code.

| Knob | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DIVE_ID` | (unset) | The Dive to render, the UUID from its URL. Required unless `SHOT_URL` is set. |
| `SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | (unset) | Service account username the Dive is rendered as. Must be a service account. |
| `REPORT_NAME` | `Dive export` | Human name for the report. Used in the filenames (slugified) and in the message text. |
| `ATTACH` | `pdf,png` | Which renditions to produce: `pdf`, `png`, or both. |
| `VIEWPORT` | `1440x1000` | Layout width and *minimum* height as `WxH`. The capture grows past the height to fit the Dive. |
| `SCALE` | `2` | PNG device pixel ratio. `1.5` for smaller files. |
| `MIN_ELEMENTS` | `30` | Refuse to store or deliver a page with fewer elements than this. `0` disables the check. |
| `MIN_WAIT_MS` | `15000` | Never capture before this many ms have passed, however quiet the page looks. |
| `WAIT_MS` | `120000` | Ceiling in ms. Past it the Flight captures anyway, or fails if `WAIT_FOR_TEXT` was set. |
| `WAIT_FOR_TEXT` | (unset) | A string only the *loaded* Dive contains. Set it and the wait keys on that instead of on DOM quiet. |
| `STORE_TABLE` | `flights_demo.main.dive_exports` | Where the BLOBs land, as `database.schema.table`. `""` skips the copy. |
| `DELIVERY` | (unset) | Comma-separated delivery targets: `slack`, `teams`, `email`. Empty stores the export and stops. |
| `DRY_RUN` | `false` | `true` renders and stores, then logs what each target would send instead of sending it. |
| `MESSAGE` | (generated) | Message text stored with the export. Defaults to `<REPORT_NAME> captured <timestamp> UTC.` |
| `API_BASE` | `https://api.motherduck.com` | REST API base. The API is region-scoped, so only a non-production environment needs this. |
| `SHOT_URL` | (unset) | Debugging only: capture this URL instead of minting a Dive session. |
| `LABEL` | `adhoc` | Label stored with a `SHOT_URL` capture. |
| `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` | (Flight-injected) | Auth for the REST API and for the write. Select a token on the Flight; never hard-code it. |

Slack delivery adds two credentials, which belong in a Flight secret rather than
in config:

| Knob | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Bot User OAuth token (`xoxb-...`) with the `files:write` and `chat:write` scopes. |
| `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` | Destination channel id (`C...`), from the channel's details in Slack. |

Teams delivery needs an Entra app registration, the channel's ids, and
optionally a webhook to announce the upload:

| Knob | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `TEAMS_TENANT_ID` | Directory (tenant) id of the Entra app registration. |
| `TEAMS_CLIENT_ID` | Application (client) id of that registration. |
| `TEAMS_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client secret for it. |
| `TEAMS_TEAM_ID` | The team's group id (`groupId` in the channel link). |
| `TEAMS_CHANNEL_ID` | The channel id (`19:...@thread.tacv2`). |
| `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` | Optional. Workflows webhook that posts the Adaptive Card linking to the uploaded files. |

Email delivery is plain SMTP, so any provider works:

| Knob | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SMTP_HOST` | (unset) | SMTP server hostname. |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `587` | SMTP port. |
| `SMTP_TLS` | `starttls` (`ssl` on port 465) | Transport security: `starttls`, `ssl` (implicit TLS), or `none` for a local relay. |
| `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASSWORD` | (unset) | Credentials. Leave unset for a relay that does not authenticate. |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | (unset) | Envelope sender. |
| `EMAIL_TO` | (unset) | Comma-separated recipients. |
| `EMAIL_SUBJECT` | `REPORT_NAME` | Subject line. |

Config is per-run overridable, so one Flight can export several Dives.

## Run it

You need a MotherDuck account, an admin read/write token, and a Dive.

First create the service account that renders the Dive (skip if you already have
one), then grant it read access on the databases the Dive queries:

```bash
export MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN=your_admin_token_here
curl -X POST "https://api.motherduck.com/v1/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"dive_export_bot"}'
```

Then run the export locally:

```bash
export DIVE_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT=dive_export_bot
uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt flight.py
```

The first local run downloads Chromium too. To check the render path without a
Dive or a service account, point it at any URL:

```bash
SHOT_URL=https://motherduck.com STORE_TABLE="" \
  uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt flight.py
```

### Set up Slack delivery

Slack's incoming webhooks cannot attach a file, so delivery uses a bot token and
the [external upload flow](https://docs.slack.dev/messaging/working-with-files/):

1. Open [api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1),
   choose **From a manifest**, select your workspace, and paste this manifest:
   ```json
   {
       "display_information": { "name": "Dive Export" },
       "features": { "bot_user": { "display_name": "Dive Export" } },
       "oauth_config": { "scopes": { "bot": ["files:write", "chat:write"] } },
       "settings": {
           "org_deploy_enabled": false,
           "socket_mode_enabled": false,
           "token_rotation_enabled": false
       }
   }
   ```
2. Review, create the app, then **Install to Workspace** and copy the **Bot User
   OAuth Token** (`xoxb-...`) from **OAuth & Permissions**.
3. Invite the bot to the destination channel (`/invite @Dive Export`). Without
   this the upload fails with `not_in_channel`.
4. Copy the channel id (`C...`) from the channel's **About** details.

Then send a real report to Slack:

```bash
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
export SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C0123456789
DELIVERY=slack uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt flight.py
```

Use `DRY_RUN=true` first to confirm the render and the filenames without posting
anything.

### Set up Teams delivery

Teams needs Microsoft Graph for the file and (optionally) a webhook for the
announcement:

1. In the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com), register
   an application (**App registrations > New registration**). Copy the
   **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**, then add a client
   secret under **Certificates & secrets**.
2. Under **API permissions**, add the Microsoft Graph **application**
   permission `Files.ReadWrite.All`, then grant admin consent. That one covers
   both calls: it resolves the channel's Files folder and writes into it. If a
   call is refused, the Graph error body names the permission it wanted; this
   Flight surfaces that body verbatim.
3. Get the ids from Teams: on the channel, **Get link to channel** produces a URL
   containing `groupId=<TEAMS_TEAM_ID>` and
   `threadId=<TEAMS_CHANNEL_ID>` (the `19:...@thread.tacv2` value).
4. Optional, for the card: in Teams open the channel's **Workflows** and create
   one from the **Post to a channel when a webhook request is received**
   template, then copy its URL as `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL`. (This replaces the retired
   Office 365 connectors.)

```bash
export TEAMS_TENANT_ID=... TEAMS_CLIENT_ID=... TEAMS_CLIENT_SECRET=...
export TEAMS_TEAM_ID=... TEAMS_CHANNEL_ID='19:...@thread.tacv2'
export TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL=https://prod-00.westeurope.logic.azure.com/...
DELIVERY=teams uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt flight.py
```

### Set up email delivery

There is no provider SDK here, just SMTP, so SES, Resend, Postmark, Google
Workspace, or an internal relay all work the same way. Point it at the
provider's submission host and attach the credentials as a secret:

```bash
export SMTP_HOST=email-smtp.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com SMTP_PORT=587
export SMTP_USER=... SMTP_PASSWORD=...
export EMAIL_FROM=reports@example.com
export EMAIL_TO='team@example.com, exec@example.com'
DELIVERY=email uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt flight.py
```

Set `SMTP_TLS=none` only for a relay on a trusted network (or a local SMTP sink
while you are testing the render).

### Getting the files out

The renditions are BLOBs, so pull the newest one through the client:

```bash
duckdb "md:?motherduck_token=$MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN" -noheader -list -c "
  SELECT to_base64(content)
  FROM flights_demo.main.dive_exports
  WHERE kind = 'pdf'
  ORDER BY captured_at DESC
  LIMIT 1
" | tail -1 | base64 --decode > dive.pdf
```

### Deploy as a Flight

Create the Flight with the `MD_CREATE_FLIGHT` SQL function (no deploy SQL is
checked in; adapt the arguments to your situation), passing:

- `name`: a Flight name, for example `dive_export`
- `source_code`: the contents of [`flight.py`](flight.py)
- `requirements_txt`: the contents of [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)
- `config`: at least `DIVE_ID`, `SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, and `DELIVERY`, plus any knob
  from the table above
- `max_runtime_sec`: optional cap on a run's duration in seconds (`0` = no cap).
  Leave room for the Chromium download on the first run.
- `flight_secret_names`: the secret holding the delivery credentials

Store the delivery credentials as a MotherDuck **Flights secret**, never in
config. The simplest way is the MotherDuck UI: open
[Settings > Secrets](https://app.motherduck.com/settings/secrets), add a secret
of type **Flights**, and give it one param per credential. The same secret can be
created from any write-enabled SQL connection (read-only connections reject
`CREATE SECRET`):

```sql
CREATE SECRET dive_export_delivery IN motherduck (
  TYPE flights,
  PARAMS MAP {
    'SLACK_BOT_TOKEN': 'xoxb-...',
    'SLACK_CHANNEL_ID': 'C0123456789',
    'TEAMS_CLIENT_SECRET': '...',
    'SMTP_PASSWORD': '...'
  }
);
```

A `TYPE flights` secret injects each param under its bare name, so the params
above arrive as `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` whatever you name the
secret. (Each param is also injected namespaced as `<secret_name>_<PARAM>`,
which disambiguates when several secrets define the same param name.)

A MotherDuck token is attached to the Flight automatically and injected at run
time as `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN`; no token argument is needed. It must be a read/write
token on an admin account, or minting the embed session fails.

Create the Flight without a schedule, trigger one run with
`MD_RUN_FLIGHT(flight_id := ...)` (the id is returned by `MD_CREATE_FLIGHT` and
listed by `MD_FLIGHTS()`; inspect a run with `MD_GET_FLIGHT_RUN(flight_id := ...,
run_number := ...)`), and look at the exported PDF before you trust it. Then add
a schedule by updating the Flight's `schedule_cron` with `MD_UPDATE_FLIGHT` (for
example `0 6 * * 1`, Mondays at 06:00 UTC). Schedule updates are metadata-only
and do not create a new Flight version.

## Security

- **The export inherits the service account's access.** Whatever that account
  can read can end up in a PDF that leaves MotherDuck, so scope its grants to
  the Dive's own data.
- **The session token stays out of the table.** `source_url` is stored without
  the URL fragment, which is where the embed session lives.
- **Identifier validation.** `STORE_TABLE` is split and each part checked
  against `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$` before it is interpolated into the `CREATE`
  and `INSERT` statements, which cannot be parameterized. Row values are bound
  parameters.
- **Delivery credentials live in a secret.** `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`,
  `TEAMS_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `SMTP_PASSWORD` are read from the environment at run
  time and never logged; put them in a Flights secret, not in Flight config,
  which is visible to anyone who can read the Flight.
- **`Files.ReadWrite.All` is tenant-wide**, and it is the narrowest permission
  that covers both hops as written. `Sites.Selected` is the usual way to scope an
  app to one site, but it is not accepted on
  [`GET /teams/{id}/channels/{id}/filesFolder`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/channel-get-filesfolder),
  so the folder cannot be resolved with it. Using it means resolving the drive
  and folder ids another way and hardcoding them, which this recipe does not do.
  Grant the tenant-wide permission to a dedicated app registration used for
  nothing else, and audit it accordingly.
- **Delivery is a data egress path.** A Dive that renders sensitive numbers
  sends them to whoever can read the destination channel or mailbox, and an
  emailed attachment leaves your control entirely. Pick the destination with that
  in mind, and keep `EMAIL_TO` in config where it is reviewable rather than
  buried in a secret.
- **Keep mail on TLS.** `SMTP_TLS=none` sends the report, and any SMTP
  credentials, in the clear. Use it only on a trusted network.
- **Treat the exports table as sensitive.** It holds rendered business data; the
  same read grants you would put on the Dive's tables belong on it.
