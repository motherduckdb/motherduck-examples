"""
Build your own analysis agent, then run it on a schedule (MotherDuck Flight).

An agent is just a loop: call a model, let it call tools, feed results back,
repeat until it answers. You do not hand-write that loop here, Pydantic AI runs
it. What makes the agent strong is what you compose around the loop:

  1. a model, via OpenRouter, so the agent is not locked to one provider
     (swap the MODEL slug for any tool-capable model),
  2. a skill: the inline SKILL constant below, your company/domain context,
  3. tools you build yourself: explore_warehouse (read-only SQL over
     sample_data) and get_weather (the Open-Meteo archive API).

The Flight discovers the active NYC boroughs in a recent window of the public
311 dataset, then fans out one agent per borough to write a "notable things"
brief, grounded in real query results and enriched with weather where it
explains activity. Briefs are written to flights_demo.main.borough_briefs. One
borough failing never aborts the batch.

The sample data is a frozen snapshot (it ends in 2023), so the lookback window
is anchored to MAX(created_date), not now(). Against a live table you would
anchor to now() instead.

Runtime inputs:
  OPENROUTER_API_KEY  remapped from a Flights secret (any *_OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
  MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN    auto-injected by the Flights runtime; used by
                      duckdb.connect for discovery, persistence, and the
                      warehouse tool
  BRIEF_WINDOW_DAYS   lookback window in days (default "7")
  CONCURRENCY         max simultaneous agents (default "3")
  MODEL               OpenRouter model slug (default "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6")
  MAX_BOROUGHS        cap borough count for testing; "0" = all (default "0")
  BOROUGHS            optional comma-separated override; skips discovery

SKILL = """\
You are a data analyst for a NYC 311 service-request operations team. You write
short, decision-useful briefs of NOTABLE activity for a single borough.

Data:
- The 311 requests are in the table sample_data.nyc.service_requests, one row per
  request. Confirm real column names before querying (query information_schema,
  not DESCRIBE). Useful columns: created_date, closed_date, agency, agency_name,
  complaint_type, descriptor, status, incident_zip, community_board,
  open_data_channel_type, borough.
- Borough values are uppercase. Exclude the 'Unspecified' borough: it is a
  catch-all with no geography, the analog of internal or test accounts.

What counts as NOTABLE:
- Complaint-type or descriptor spikes vs the rest of the window.
- Agencies with unusually slow or aging open requests (compare created_date to
  closed_date and current status).
- Zip-code or community-board hotspots.
- Shifts in how requests arrive (open_data_channel_type).
- Weather that plausibly explains activity: a heavy-rain day preceding a flooding
  or sewer spike, a heat spell preceding heat or cooling complaints. Use the
  get_weather tool for this; do not force a weather angle if the data does not
  support one.

Borough coordinates for get_weather (latitude, longitude):
- MANHATTAN: 40.7831, -73.9712
- BROOKLYN: 40.6782, -73.9442

- BRONX: 40.8448, -73.8648
- STATEN ISLAND: 40.5795, -74.1502

Guardrails:
- Ground every claim in a query you ran. Never invent numbers.
- If a query returns nothing, say so rather than guessing.
- Only SELECT is allowed. Use information_schema or SELECT ... LIMIT 0 to explore.
