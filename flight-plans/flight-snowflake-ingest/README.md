# Ingest Snowflake Tables into MotherDuck From a Flight

A single-file Flight that ingests Snowflake tables into MotherDuck in two phases.
It is the Snowflake side of a migration onto MotherDuck: keep Snowflake as the
source of truth while you build out MotherDuck, and re-run the Flight to copy the
tables you select. It is deliberately just the ingest mechanics: no UI, no
per-table Flights, just `discover` and `move`.

- **DISCOVER** connects to Snowflake, enumerates the tables in scope from
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`, and writes that inventory to a MotherDuck control
  table with a `selected` flag you can edit to choose what to move.
- **MOVE** reads the inventory and selection back from MotherDuck, pulls each
  selected table from Snowflake via Arrow, loads it into MotherDuck with
  `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ... AS SELECT`, and records a per-table ledger.

A `MODE` config picks the phase: `discover`, `move`, or `all` (discover then
move in one run). There is no first-class DuckDB `snowflake` extension, so the
path is `snowflake-connector-python` (Arrow fetch) into a DuckDB-registered Arrow
object, then a CTAS into `md:`.

## What you'll adjust

Every knob is read from Flight config/env, so you adapt this template by setting
config values rather than editing code. The Snowflake password (and, if you like,
the user) is the exception: it comes from a MotherDuck Flights secret, never from
plain config.

| Knob | Where | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MODE` | config / env | `all` | Which phase to run: `discover`, `move`, or `all`. |
| `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT` | config / env | (required) | Snowflake account identifier, for example `ab12345.eu-west-1`. |
| `SNOWFLAKE_USER` | config / env or Flight secret | (required) | Snowflake login user. Can sit in plain config, or alongside the password in a Flights secret (arrives as `<secret_name>_SNOWFLAKE_USER`); `flight.py` resolves either. |
| `SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE` | config / env | (unset) | Warehouse for the discovery and move queries. Effectively required: querying `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` needs an active warehouse, so without one discovery finds 0 tables. (`SHOW DATABASES` itself does not need a warehouse.) |
| `SNOWFLAKE_ROLE` | config / env | (unset) | Role to assume. Optional. |
| `SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE` | config / env | (unset) | Source database to scan. Leave it unset to scan every database the connection can see (enumerated with `SHOW TERSE DATABASES`), or set it to scope to one database. Validated as a SQL identifier when set. |
| `SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA` | config / env | (unset) | Optional single schema name to narrow discovery to, applied in each database scanned. Validated as a SQL identifier. |
| `TARGET_DB` | config / env | `flights_demo` | MotherDuck database that receives the control tables and moved tables. |
| `TARGET_SCHEMA` | config / env | `main` | Schema in `TARGET_DB` where moved tables land. |
| `CONTROL_SCHEMA` | config / env | `main` | Schema in `TARGET_DB` that holds the inventory and ledger tables. |
| `INVENTORY_TABLE` | config / env | `snowflake_inventory` | Control table name: the inventory of source tables with a `selected` flag. |
| `LEDGER_TABLE` | config / env | `snowflake_move_runs` | Per-table move ledger name. |
| `MAX_ROWS_PER_TABLE` | config / env | `0` | Optional `LIMIT` per table during move (`0` means no cap). Useful for a sampled first pass. |
| `DRY_RUN` | config / env | `true` | When true, MOVE logs the plan and writes ledger rows without copying data. Set `false` to copy for real. |
| `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD` | Flight secret / env var | (required) | The Snowflake credential. Add it through a MotherDuck Flights secret (in the UI, see below), never in code or config. As a Flight the secret arrives as `<secret_name>_SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD`; `flight.py` resolves either name. |
| `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` | Flight-injected | (Flight-injected) | Auth for MotherDuck. Select a token on the Flight; never hard-code it. |

## Questions to answer

- What is in scope: one Snowflake database (set `SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE`), or every visible database (leave it unset)? And optionally one schema?
- Which account, user, warehouse, and role should the Flight connect with, and are the credentials stored as a MotherDuck Flights secret? Discovery needs a warehouse.
- Where should the inventory, ledger, and moved tables live in MotherDuck (`TARGET_DB`, `TARGET_SCHEMA`, `CONTROL_SCHEMA`)?
- After discovery, which tables should actually move? Edit the `selected` column, or accept the default rule (base tables only).
- Are any in-scope tables large enough to need staging or a `MAX_ROWS_PER_TABLE` sample first?
- Which service account token can write to `TARGET_DB`?

## Run it

You need a MotherDuck account and an access token, a reachable Snowflake account,
and the Snowflake password. There is no credential-free smoke test: the discover
phase has to reach a real Snowflake account (see [Caveats](#caveats)).

```bash
export MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN=your_token_here
export SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=ab12345.eu-west-1
export SNOWFLAKE_USER=your_user
export SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=your_wh        # required for discovery: INFORMATION_SCHEMA needs an active warehouse
# export SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE=SOURCE_DB     # omit to scan EVERY visible database
# export SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=PUBLIC          # optional: narrow to one schema
export SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=your_password   # local only; use a secret for a Flight

# Phase 1: build the inventory in MotherDuck, then edit `selected` as needed.
MODE=discover uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt flight.py

# Phase 2: copy the selected tables. DRY_RUN defaults to true (plan only);
# set DRY_RUN=false to copy for real once you have reviewed the inventory.
MODE=move DRY_RUN=false uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt flight.py
```

After `MODE=discover`, inspect and curate the inventory in MotherDuck, for
example:

```sql
SELECT table_schema, table_name, table_type, row_count, bytes, selected
FROM flights_demo.main.snowflake_inventory
ORDER BY bytes DESC;

-- Move only one schema's base tables:
UPDATE flights_demo.main.snowflake_inventory
SET selected = (table_schema = 'PUBLIC' AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE');
```

`MODE=all` runs discover then move in one go (still honoring `DRY_RUN`), which is
handy once your selection rule is stable.

### Deploy as a Flight

Store the Snowflake credentials as a MotherDuck **Flights secret**. The simplest
way is the MotherDuck UI: open
[Settings > Secrets](https://app.motherduck.com/settings/secrets), add a secret of
type **Flights**, and give it `SNOWFLAKE_USER` and `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD` parameters.
If you would rather use SQL, you can create the same secret from the DuckDB client
or any SQL connection (the read-only `query` MCP tool rejects `CREATE SECRET`, so
use `query_rw` or a direct connection):

```sql
CREATE SECRET snowflake_creds IN motherduck (
  TYPE flights,
  PARAMS MAP {
    'SNOWFLAKE_USER': 'your_user',
    'SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD': 'your_password'
  }
);
```

A `TYPE flights` secret injects each param under the env var
`<secret_name>_<PARAM>`, not the bare param name: the params above arrive as
`snowflake_creds_SNOWFLAKE_USER` and `snowflake_creds_SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD`. (DuckDB
lowercases the unquoted secret name into the prefix.) `flight.py` handles this: it
reads the bare `SNOWFLAKE_USER` / `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD` for local runs and otherwise
picks up any env var ending in `_SNOWFLAKE_USER` / `_SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD`, so the
secret name you choose does not matter.

Then deploy with the MotherDuck MCP server rather than checked-in SQL. Call
`get_flight_guide` first for the exact tool arguments, then `create_flight` with:

- `source_code`: the contents of [`flight.py`](flight.py)
- `requirements_txt`: the contents of [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt)
- `access_token_name`: a service account token that can write `TARGET_DB` (list
  tokens with the `md_access_tokens()` table function); the runtime injects its
  value as `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN`
- `config`: the non-secret knobs, for example
  `{"MODE": "discover", "SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT": "ab12345.eu-west-1", "SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE": "your_wh", "SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE": "SOURCE_DB", "TARGET_DB": "flights_demo", "DRY_RUN": "true"}`
- `flight_secret_names`: `["snowflake_creds"]` so the user and password are
  injected (as `snowflake_creds_SNOWFLAKE_USER` / `snowflake_creds_SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD`;
  `flight.py` resolves them)

Create the Flight with `MODE=discover`, trigger one manual run with `run_flight`,
and confirm the inventory lands in MotherDuck. Curate `selected`, then run
`MODE=move` with `DRY_RUN=false` (a config change, not a new Flight version) to
copy. Schedule it only if you want a recurring refresh.

## How it works

`flight.py` connects to MotherDuck (`md:`), creates `TARGET_DB`, the control
schema, and the target schema if missing, then runs one or both phases:

1. **DISCOVER.** Determine the databases in scope: just `SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE` when
   set, otherwise every database the connection can see (via `SHOW TERSE
   DATABASES`). For each, query its `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` (optionally
   filtered to `SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA`), listing `table_catalog, table_schema,
   table_name, row_count, bytes, table_type`, and skip any database the role
   cannot read. Write the combined result to the inventory control table with an
   added `selected BOOLEAN` (defaulted to `table_type = 'BASE TABLE'`) and a
   `discovered_at` timestamp. The write is a `CREATE OR REPLACE`, so re-discovery
   refreshes the inventory.
2. **MOVE.** Read the rows where `selected` is true. For each, run
   `SELECT * FROM <db>.<schema>.<table>` in Snowflake, fetch the result as one
   Arrow table with `cursor.fetch_arrow_all()`, register that Arrow object with
   the DuckDB connection, and `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
   <TARGET_DB>.<TARGET_SCHEMA>.<table> AS SELECT * FROM <arrow>`. Each table is
   idempotent (replace on re-run). A failure on one table is recorded and the run
   continues. Every move (including dry-run skips) writes one row to the ledger:
   source table, dest table, row count, status, detail, run timestamp, dry-run
   flag.

`MODE=all` runs DISCOVER then MOVE in a single run.

## Caveats

- **No credential-free smoke test.** Unlike the `sample_data`-backed templates
  here, this Flight needs a real, reachable Snowflake account even to discover.
  There is no offline dry run of the Snowflake side; the closest thing is
  `DRY_RUN=true`, which still discovers but does not copy data.
- **Discovery needs an active warehouse.** `SHOW TERSE DATABASES` runs without
  one, but `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` does not: with no warehouse every
  per-database scan fails with "No active warehouse selected" and is skipped, so
  the inventory comes back empty. Set `SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE` (or give the connecting
  user a default warehouse). Verified live: an account-wide scan of 4 databases
  found 315 tables once a warehouse was set, and 0 before.
- **Account-wide scan includes shared and system databases.** Leaving
  `SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE` unset scans everything `SHOW TERSE DATABASES` returns,
  which can include `SNOWFLAKE` (account views) and `SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA`. Only
  base tables are pre-`selected`, so views are inventoried but not moved by
  default. Curate `selected` before moving, and note that the move destination is
  keyed on table name alone, so same-named tables across databases or schemas
  would collide in `TARGET_DB`.
- **Re-discovery resets manual `selected` edits.** DISCOVER does a
  `CREATE OR REPLACE` of the inventory, so any hand edits to `selected` are lost
  on the next discover. To keep a curated selection, either stop re-discovering,
  apply a deterministic `UPDATE ... SET selected = (...)` rule after each
  discover, or maintain your selection in a separate table you join against.
- **Snowflake compute and egress cost money.** Every discover query and every
  `SELECT *` runs on a Snowflake warehouse and transfers data out. Use a small
  warehouse, scope tightly with `SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA`, and consider
  `MAX_ROWS_PER_TABLE` for a sampled first pass.
- **`ACCOUNT_USAGE` lags.** The account-wide alternative,
  `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLES`, spans all databases but is delayed by up to
  ~90 minutes and lists dropped tables until purged. This template uses the live,
  exact `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`, which is scoped to one database.
- **Very large tables use memory.** MOVE fetches each table's full result into
  one in-memory Arrow table. A Flight has a ~16GB RAM ceiling and ~150GB of local
  scratch on `/tmp`. For a table that will not fit in memory, stage it to local
  Parquet on `/tmp` first (`COPY ... TO '/tmp/...parquet'` from Snowflake or a
  paged Arrow write), then load from Parquet, instead of one big `fetch_arrow_all`.
- **`DRY_RUN` defaults to true.** MOVE writes real tables, so the first deploy
  logs the move plan and writes ledger rows without copying. Set `DRY_RUN=false`
  once you have reviewed the inventory.

## Security

- **Credentials in a secret, not config.** `SNOWFLAKE_USER` and
  `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD` are read from a MotherDuck `TYPE flights` secret (or local
  env vars) at runtime, never hard-coded or placed in Flight `config`. The same
  resolver supports a private-key credential if you swap the connection params.
- **Identifier validation.** Every config-supplied database, schema, and table
  name (`SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE`, `SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA`, `TARGET_DB`, `TARGET_SCHEMA`,
  `CONTROL_SCHEMA`, `INVENTORY_TABLE`, `LEDGER_TABLE`) is checked against
  `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$` before any SQL runs. Per-table names read from the
  inventory at runtime are quoted with `ident()` before interpolation.
- **Parameterized data.** Inventory rows and ledger rows (table names, row
  counts, status, detail) are written with bound parameters, and the optional
  schema filter in discovery is a bound parameter, never string-formatted SQL.
