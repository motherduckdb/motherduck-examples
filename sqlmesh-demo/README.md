# Transform Stock Data with SQLMesh on MotherDuck

This example loads daily stock prices, company info, and option chains from Yahoo Finance into a MotherDuck database with [dlt](https://dlthub.com/), then transforms the raw `dlt` tables into analytics models with [SQLMesh](https://sqlmesh.com/). It is a re-implementation of the `matsonj/stocks` dbt demo on SQLMesh, and it shows the MotherDuck pattern of pointing a SQLMesh `motherduck` gateway at a cloud database and using SQLMesh model kinds (incremental by time range, SCD type 2, full, view) plus column-level audits to build a layered warehouse, all running against MotherDuck compute.

The data flows in three stages: `dlt` writes raw tables into the `stock_data` schema, SQLMesh declares those raw tables as external models, then SQLMesh builds `interim` (typed and cleaned), `conformed` (business-ready), and `mart` (joined analytics) layers on top.

## How it works

### dlt load

`load/stock_data_pipeline.py` runs three dlt resources, each with `write_disposition="replace"`:

- `stock_info_resource` (`stock_info`, primary key `Symbol`): per-ticker company info from `yfinance`. dlt also splits the nested `companyOfficers` list into a child table, `stock_info__company_officers`.
- `stock_options_resource` (`stock_options`, composite key on symbol, expiration, strike, type, contract symbol): the full call and put option chain for every expiration date.
- `stock_history_resource` (`stock_history`, key `Symbol` + `Date`): daily OHLCV history for the trailing 360 days.

Symbols are read from `symbols.txt` and validated before fetch:

```python
def validate_symbol(symbol: str) -> bool:
    """Validates a symbol using yfinance."""
    try:
        stock = yf.Ticker(symbol)
        return not stock.history(period="1d").empty
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error validating symbol {symbol}: {e}")
        return False
```

The history loader coerces each OHLCV value defensively because `yfinance` may return a scalar or a one-element `pd.Series` depending on the call:

```python
"Close": float(row["Close"].iloc[0])
    if isinstance(row["Close"], pd.Series)
    else float(row["Close"]),
```

### SQLMesh transform

- `transform/external_models.yaml`: the contract for the upstream dlt tables. It declares `stock_history`, `stock_info`, `stock_info__company_officers`, `stock_options`, and `_dlt_loads` with their column types so SQLMesh knows the raw schema without managing it. Regenerate it with `sqlmesh create_external_models` whenever the raw schema changes.
- `transform/models/interim/`: typed, cleaned models over the raw dlt tables. `stock_history` is `INCREMENTAL_BY_TIME_RANGE` on `trade_date`; `stock_info`, `stock_options`, and `stock_info__company_officers` are `SCD_TYPE_2_BY_TIME` so they track changes to company info and option chains over time. The SCD models derive their `updated_at` column from the dlt load id:

  ```sql
  TO_TIMESTAMP(_dlt_load_id::DOUBLE) AS _dlt_load_time
  ```

  The incremental history model filters on the SQLMesh time macros so each run only processes its slice:

  ```sql
  FROM stock_data.stock_history
  WHERE trade_date BETWEEN @start_ts AND @end_ts
  ```

- `transform/models/conformed/`: business-ready models. `price_history` is a `VIEW` over interim history; `company_info` is a `FULL` model that keeps only the current SCD row (`WHERE valid_to IS NULL`).
- `transform/models/mart/stock_price_by_day.sql`: a `VIEW` that joins shares outstanding to daily close for a market-cap time series:

  ```sql
  SELECT
    c.symbol AS stock_symbol,
    c.shares_outstanding,
    sp.close,
    sp.trade_date,
    ROUND(c.shares_outstanding::REAL * sp.close::REAL, 0) AS market_cap
  FROM conformed.company_info AS c
  LEFT JOIN conformed.price_history AS sp
    ON c.symbol = sp.symbol
  ```

- Audits run at execution time: `UNIQUE_COMBINATION_OF_COLUMNS`, `NOT_NULL`, and `UNIQUE_VALUES`. A failed audit blocks the model from being promoted, which is how data quality is enforced rather than just reported.

## What you'll adjust

| Setting | Purpose | Options / example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `load/symbols.txt` | The tickers the dlt pipeline fetches, one per line | `MSFT`, `AAPL`, `NVDA`, ... swap for your own list (ships with 11 large-cap symbols) |
| `dataset_name` in `load/stock_data_pipeline.py` | Schema the raw dlt tables land in | `"stock_data"` (referenced by SQLMesh models as `stock_data.<table>`) |
| `destination` in `load/stock_data_pipeline.py` | Where dlt writes the raw data | `"motherduck"` (configured via `.dlt/secrets.toml`) |
| `start_date` window in `stock_history_resource` | How far back history is pulled | `datetime.now() - timedelta(days=360)` |
| `gateways.local.connection.database` in `transform/config.yaml` | MotherDuck database SQLMesh reads and writes | `dlt_test_db` (must match the dlt destination database) |
| `model_defaults.start` in `transform/config.yaml` | Default backfill start for time-based models | `2024-12-08` |
| `start` in `transform/models/interim/stock_history.sql` | Backfill start for the incremental price model | `'2023-01-01'` |
| Model `kind` per model | Materialization strategy | `INCREMENTAL_BY_TIME_RANGE` (history), `SCD_TYPE_2_BY_TIME` (info/options/officers), `FULL`, `VIEW` |
| `cron` per model | How often SQLMesh refreshes the model | `'@daily'` on the interim, conformed, and full models |
| `audits (...)` per model | Data quality checks enforced at run time | `UNIQUE_COMBINATION_OF_COLUMNS`, `NOT_NULL`, `UNIQUE_VALUES` |
| `transform/external_models.yaml` | Declares the raw dlt tables (and their columns) as external sources | regenerate with `sqlmesh create_external_models` after a load |

## Questions to answer

- Which tickers or source dataset should the pipeline load (replace `symbols.txt`, or swap dlt for a different source)?
- What MotherDuck database and schema are the target? Set both the dlt `destination` database and `transform/config.yaml` `database`, and keep them in sync.
- Full refresh or incremental, and what is the backfill start date for time-based models?
- How often should models run (the `@daily` cron, or a different cadence)?
- Where will the MotherDuck token come from (the `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` env var and `.dlt/secrets.toml`)?

## Run it

Prerequisites: a [MotherDuck account](https://app.motherduck.com/) and a service token, plus [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

```bash
# from sqlmesh-demo/
uv sync                       # create the venv and install dlt + sqlmesh + yfinance

# point dlt at MotherDuck (token goes in .dlt/secrets.toml; see dlt docs link below)
# then load the raw stock data into MotherDuck:
uv run python load/stock_data_pipeline.py

# transform with SQLMesh (run from the transform/ dir, or pass -p transform)
export MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN=<your-token>
uv run sqlmesh -p transform info     # verify the connection and project state
uv run sqlmesh -p transform plan     # preview and apply; type 'y' to push the changes

# optional: open the SQLMesh web UI (the [web] extra is installed)
uv run sqlmesh -p transform ui
```

If SQLMesh cannot find your token during `info`/`plan`, make sure `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` is exported in the same shell (the web UI also picks it up).

### Connection details

- `dlt` writes via the `motherduck` destination. The database name and token go in `.dlt/secrets.toml` and are documented in the [dlt MotherDuck destination guide](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations/motherduck#setup-guide). The default `pipeline_name` and `dataset_name` are both `stock_data`.
- SQLMesh connects with a `motherduck` gateway in `transform/config.yaml` (`type: motherduck`, `database: dlt_test_db`), authenticated by `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN`. The dlt destination database and the SQLMesh `database` must point at the same MotherDuck database, or SQLMesh will not find the raw `stock_data` tables.

## Files

- [`load/stock_data_pipeline.py`](load/stock_data_pipeline.py) - the dlt load: fetches info, options, and history from yfinance for each ticker and writes raw tables into the `stock_data` schema on MotherDuck.
- [`load/symbols.txt`](load/symbols.txt) - the ticker list, one symbol per line (ships with 11 large-cap names: MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, ...). Edit to load your own.
- [`transform/config.yaml`](transform/config.yaml) - the SQLMesh project config: defines the `motherduck` gateway, target database (`dlt_test_db`), DuckDB dialect, and default backfill start.
- [`transform/external_models.yaml`](transform/external_models.yaml) - declares the raw dlt tables and their columns as external sources so SQLMesh knows the upstream schema. Regenerate with `sqlmesh create_external_models`.
- [`transform/models/`](transform/models/) - the SQLMesh models in three layers: `interim/` (typed and cleaned, incremental and SCD type 2 over the raw dlt tables), `conformed/` (business-ready view and full models), and `mart/` (the joined market-cap analytics view).
- [`transform/`](transform/) - the SQLMesh root, also holding empty scaffold dirs (`audits/`, `macros/`, `seeds/`, `tests/`) for project growth.
- [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) - the uv project definition: pins dlt, duckdb, sqlmesh (with the web UI extra), and yfinance.
- [`uv.lock`](uv.lock) - the pinned dependency lockfile for reproducible `uv sync`.

## Caveats

- **Keep the two database names in sync.** SQLMesh reads the raw tables from the same MotherDuck database dlt wrote to. If `transform/config.yaml` `database` does not match the dlt destination database (`dlt_test_db` by default), `sqlmesh plan` will fail to resolve `stock_data.*`.
- **Token must be in the right place for the right tool.** dlt reads the token from `.dlt/secrets.toml`; SQLMesh reads it from `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN`. Setting only one will make the other step fail. Do not commit the token; keep it in `.dlt/secrets.toml` (gitignored) and your shell env, not in `config.yaml`.
- **Regenerate external models after schema changes.** `external_models.yaml` is a static snapshot of the dlt output columns. `yfinance` periodically adds or renames `stock_info` fields, so a new load can drift from the declared schema. Re-run `sqlmesh create_external_models` after loads that change the raw shape, or SQLMesh will reference columns that no longer match.
- **`write_disposition="replace"` is a full reload.** Every `dlt` run truncates and reloads the raw tables. The SCD type 2 history in SQLMesh comes from the `_dlt_load_time` snapshots, not from dlt itself, so you only capture change history if you load on a schedule (each load is one snapshot in time).
- **`yfinance` is unofficial and rate-limited.** Symbols are validated with a 1-day history probe before fetching, and resources swallow per-symbol exceptions and print to stdout rather than failing the run. A symbol that returns no data is skipped silently, so check the load output if a ticker is missing downstream. Large symbol lists, especially option chains, can be slow and may hit Yahoo throttling.
- **History defaults to a 360-day window.** `stock_history_resource` only pulls the trailing 360 days, while the incremental model's `start` is `'2023-01-01'`. Backfilling earlier than what dlt loaded produces empty slices, not older data; widen the dlt window first.
- **The interim layer is hand-maintained typed SQL.** Each interim model casts every column explicitly (for example `close::DOUBLE`, `symbol::TEXT`). If you add tickers with new `stock_info` fields you want downstream, you must add the casts to the interim model yourself; the raw-to-interim mapping is not automatic.
