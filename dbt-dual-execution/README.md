title: dbt Dual Execution Across Local DuckDB and MotherDuck
id: dbt-dual-execution
description: >-
  A dbt-duckdb project that runs the same models against MotherDuck and a local
  DuckDB file in one execution context, using DuckDB's ATTACH so individual
  models can land in the cloud or on disk. Use when you want to develop or
  sample dbt models locally against a local file while still reading from (and
  writing to) MotherDuck, without maintaining two separate projects.

# dbt Dual Execution Across Local DuckDB and MotherDuck

This is a minimal dbt-duckdb project that shows MotherDuck dual execution: a single dbt run that has both a MotherDuck connection and a local DuckDB file attached at the same time. Because both databases live in one DuckDB execution context (via DuckDB's `ATTACH`), you choose per model where a table materializes by setting its `database` config. The `example/` models hop cloud -> local -> cloud, and the `tpcds/` models read from a MotherDuck source and sample down when the target is local, so you can iterate on transformations cheaply on disk and promote the same code to the cloud unchanged.

## How dual execution works

The trick is that `ATTACH` brings MotherDuck databases and a local DuckDB file into one DuckDB session. Once attached, you address each by its database name, and dbt's `database=` config decides where each model materializes.

The `local` profile output (the default target) sets `path: local.db` and attaches all of MotherDuck:

```yaml
dual_execution:
  outputs:
    local:
      type: duckdb
      path: local.db
      attach:
        - path: "md:"        # attaches all MotherDuck databases
      threads: 4
    prod:
      type: duckdb
      path: "md:jdw_dev"     # connect straight to one MotherDuck database
      threads: 4
  target: local
```

Pin an individual model to a MotherDuck database with the `database` config:

```sql
{{ config(
    database="my_db",
    materialized="table"
) }}
```

To keep a model on the local file instead, omit `database` so it falls back to the target's default database. Under `--target local` the default is the `local.db` file, so the model lands on disk. The `example/` models use exactly this pattern: `my_first_dbt_model` and `my_third_dbt_model` set `database="my_db"` (cloud), while `my_second_dbt_model` has no `database` config, so it materializes in the local default database. Following the `ref()` chain shows data moving cloud -> local -> cloud within a single run:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[my_first_dbt_model - cloud my_db] --> B[my_second_dbt_model - local local.db]
    B --> C[my_third_dbt_model - cloud my_db]
```

The `tpcds/` models show the read side of the pattern. The `tpcds/raw/` models `select from` a MotherDuck source defined in `_sources.yml`, and `store_sales.sql` guards the read with the target name so local runs sample 1% while the cloud reads everything:

```sql
from {{ source("tpc-ds", "store_sales") }}
{% if target.name == 'local' %} using sample 1 % {% endif %}
```

The `tpcds/queries/` models (`query_1.sql` ... `query_99.sql`) are the TPC-DS analytical queries materialized as views on top of the raw models.

## What you'll adjust

| Setting | Purpose | Options / example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `profiles.yml` target | Which execution context dbt connects to. `local` connects to a local file and attaches all MotherDuck databases; `prod` connects directly to a MotherDuck database. | `--target local` (default) or `--target prod` |
| `local.path` (profiles `local` output) | Path of the on-disk DuckDB file. This is also the *default* database for `local` runs, so any model without an explicit `database=` lands here. | `path: local.db` |
| `local.attach` (profiles `local` output) | What gets attached alongside the local file. `"md:"` attaches every MotherDuck database; narrow it to one with `md:my_db` to limit scope and speed up startup. | `attach: - path: "md:"` |
| `prod.path` (profiles `prod` output) | The MotherDuck database used when running directly in the cloud (the default database under `--target prod`). | `path: "md:jdw_dev"` |
| `database=` in `{{ config(...) }}` | Per-model choice of where a table lands: a MotherDuck database name (cloud) or omit it to use the target's default database. | `database="my_db"` (cloud) |
| `models/tpcds/raw/_sources.yml` | The MotherDuck source the `tpcds` raw models read from. Repoint these to your own database/schema. | `database: jdw_dev`, `schema: jdw_tpcds` |
| `{% if target.name == 'local' %}` sampling | Reduces source rows on local runs so iteration is fast; full data runs in the cloud. | `using sample 1 %` in `models/tpcds/raw/store_sales.sql` |
| `dbt_project.yml` model materializations | Default materialization per folder (`example` as views, `tpcds/raw` as tables, `tpcds/queries` as views). | `+materialized: table` / `view`, `+tags: ['raw']` |
| `threads` (both profile outputs) | dbt concurrency for the run. | `threads: 4` |

## Questions to answer

- Which MotherDuck database(s) should models target, and which models should stay local on disk (no explicit `database=`)?
- What is the source database and schema the raw models should read from (here `jdw_dev.jdw_tpcds`)? Does it already exist in your account?
- Should local runs sample the source data, and at what rate, or read it in full?
- Local-only iteration, cloud-only, or the dual (attach both) setup as configured here?
- Is a MotherDuck token already configured in the shell, or should auth happen via the browser prompt?

## Run it

Prerequisites: a MotherDuck account, dbt-duckdb (pinned to `1.9.3` in `pyproject.toml`), and (for non-interactive runs) a `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` in your shell. The source database and schema referenced in `_sources.yml` (`jdw_dev.jdw_tpcds`) must exist in your account, or repoint them to your own tables before running the `tpcds` models.

```bash
# install dbt-duckdb into a managed venv
uv sync

# build everything with the default target (local file + attached MotherDuck)
uv run dbt build

# or pick a target explicitly
uv run dbt run --target local   # writes default-db materializations to local.db, reads MotherDuck
uv run dbt run --target prod    # runs directly against the MotherDuck database in profiles.yml
```

The first cloud run opens a browser prompt for MotherDuck authentication unless `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` is already set in the shell.

## Files

- [`dbt_project.yml`](dbt_project.yml) - the dbt project config: names the project `dual_execution` and sets per-folder defaults (`example` as views, `tpcds/raw` as tables, `tpcds/queries` as views).
- [`profiles.yml`](profiles.yml) - the two connection targets: `local` (local.db plus `attach: "md:"`) and `prod` (direct `md:jdw_dev`), with `local` as the default target.
- [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) - the Python project for `uv`, pinning `dbt-duckdb==1.9.3`.
- [`uv.lock`](uv.lock) - the resolved dependency lockfile for `uv sync`.
- [`models/example/`](models/example/) - the cloud -> local -> cloud demo: three starter models where `my_first`/`my_third` set `database="my_db"` (cloud) and `my_second` omits it (local), plus [`schema.yml`](models/example/schema.yml) with unique/not_null tests.
- [`models/tpcds/raw/`](models/tpcds/raw/) - 24 raw models that select from the MotherDuck TPC-DS source; `store_sales.sql` shows the `target.name == 'local'` sampling guard. Source is defined in [`_sources.yml`](models/tpcds/raw/_sources.yml) (`jdw_dev.jdw_tpcds`).
- [`models/tpcds/queries/`](models/tpcds/queries/) - the 99 TPC-DS analytical queries (`query_1.sql` ... `query_99.sql`) materialized as views on top of the raw models.
- [`analyses/`](analyses/), [`macros/`](macros/), [`seeds/`](seeds/), [`snapshots/`](snapshots/), [`tests/`](tests/) - the standard empty dbt scaffold directories (each holds only a `.gitkeep`).
- [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) - excludes dbt build output and `*.db`, so the local `local.db` is intentionally not version-controlled.
- `.python-version`, `.user.yml` - the pinned Python version for `uv` and dbt's per-user invocation id.

## Caveats

- **Same database name across targets.** `database="my_db"` is hard-coded in the `example/` models. Under `--target local` that name resolves only because `attach: "md:"` brings `my_db` into the session, and under `--target prod` it resolves only if `my_db` exists in your account. If the database does not exist in MotherDuck, the run fails. Create it first or change the name.
- **Switching targets changes where "local" models land.** Models without `database=` follow the target default. With `--target prod` (default db `md:jdw_dev`) those models materialize in the cloud, not on disk, so `--target prod` is not a true "everything in cloud" run unless every model pins its `database`.
- **`attach: "md:"` attaches everything.** It pulls in all MotherDuck databases on every local run, which can be slow if you have many. Narrow it to `md:my_db` when you only need one.
- **Source must exist before the raw models run.** `_sources.yml` points at `jdw_dev.jdw_tpcds`. dbt does not create sources; if that database/schema is absent (or you have not been granted access), the `tpcds` models error. Repoint `_sources.yml` to data you actually have.
- **Sampling only kicks in on the `local` target.** The `using sample 1 %` clause is gated by `target.name == 'local'`. Renaming the local target, or running under any other target, silently reads the full source, which can be expensive on large tables.
- **Don't put your token in `profiles.yml`.** Authenticate with the `MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN` environment variable (or the browser prompt), not by committing a token into the profile or connection string.
- **`*.db` is gitignored.** The local `local.db` file is excluded by `.gitignore`, so local materializations are intentionally not version-controlled; expect a fresh file on a clean checkout.
- **dbt-duckdb version is pinned.** `pyproject.toml` pins `dbt-duckdb==1.9.3`. The ATTACH/dual-execution behavior here is verified against that version; newer or older releases may differ.
